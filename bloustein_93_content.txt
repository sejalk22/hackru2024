The AI+data informatics revolution has arrived in the public & private sectors. Become a leader in the rapidly growing field of Public Informatics!





The Bloustein School’s Master of Public Informatics serves as the prominent and distinguished program for educating highly talented professional student cohorts in the competencies needed in public informatics, advanced data science and analytics, which includes topics such as: machine learning, global data analytics, artificial intelligence, textual analytics and natural language processing, statistics, programming, data management, GIS, visualization, spatial analysis, domain applications, and the application of these skills for domain-specific value creation. The MPI program at Rutgers provides excellent state-of-the-art research driven project opportunities. Graduates of the MPI program will provide a deep understanding of advanced data science and analytics methods, context and public benefit perspectives to this fast growing and high demand domain.
An AI+data revolution is underway in the fields of city planning, policy, operations, healthcare, public administration, business management, GIS, transportation and energy, to name a few. We now have a vast array of data collection mechanisms such as IoT based ubiquitous sensors, telecommunications networks. We can use AI, advanced data science and analytics methods to make evidence-based decision making more feasible. Public informatics is the study of advanced AI+data topics for societal benefit.
The limiting factor to the successful use of the massive AI+data value creation paradigm  is the absence of appropriately trained informatics professionals. Public informatics, as an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, advanced analytics and information systems to extract knowledge or insights from various forms of structured or unstructured data, is a critical domain with an increasingly significant need for well trained data scientists. Cross-trained data science professionals with skills in public applications of information science are needed to address this growing need for public informatics graduates.

Training Advanced Informatics and Data Science Professionals for Public Good

About the Public Informatics Program

The Master of Public Informatics (MPI) program imparts high-quality research and thought leadership-based education in advanced data science, domain specific analytics and informatics for decision making and improved outcomes in public policy analytics, urban and regional planning informatics, and GIS, healthcare, energy, transportation and management analytics. Subject areas include topics in geographic information science, machine learning, global data analytics, artificial intelligence, textual analytics and natural language processing, statistics, programming, data management, visualization, spatial analysis, domain applications, and the application of these skills for domain-specific value creation.
The MPI degree will be tremendously valuable for both public service and corporate/business careers. Public informatics is critical for local and national policy-making, and data driven decision making in numerous public domains, including energy, transportation, urban planning, GIS and healthcare. The MPI degree can also be a vital asset for private sector professionals as corporations and businesses seek to leverage public informatics to guide their long-term strategy towards improved profitability and KPIs, and day to day operations in sustainability, corporate governance, compliance, civic trends and insights, and public perceptions of products, services, and brands.  There appears to be a growing demand for public informatics graduates based on the rising employer demand for professionals with advanced data science, artificial intelligence and domain specific data science, analytics and informatics capabilities.

Why invest in a degree?
The MPI degree will be valuable asset for those seeking to advance their careers in informatics, data science, analytics and applied AI leadership:

The MPI degree provides an excellent and unique curriculum for the study of advanced data science, analytics, informatics and AI topics.
MPI program graduates will have a distinguished standing as a part of Rutgers, a globally reputed top ranked University.
The MPI program runs small cohorts with a diverse student population and a strong international participation, leading to peer learning opportunities.
The MPI program offers numerous specializations including GIS, Transportation, Energy, Robotics, Data Visualization, Healthcare and Artificial Intelligence.
The MPI program is flexible and allows for the development of customized concentration and students may be allowed to substitute courses upon meeting requirements.
The Bloustein School offers a great student supportive environment, and students will have opportunities through the Public Informatics Students Group (PISG).
Given the vast academic and professional networks associated with Rutgers, students will have increased opportunities for internships, practical training (3-year STEM OPT for international students) and jobs. This includes optional career support activities and training as well.
The Bloustein School has many distinguished faculty and well-established centers – skilled students will have opportunities to work on real-world projects, research initiatives and other projects at these centers and labs at the school, and across Rutgers University.
Upon graduation, MPI graduates can be proud for a lifetime to be recognized as belonging to the strong Rutgers alumni network and the vast possibilities associated with it!


Who should apply?
The MPI program aims to identify and welcome students who can be successful in this rigorous STEM designated program and in their subsequent careers in informatics, data science, analytics and AI leadership.
The Rutgers MPI program is suitable for students with undergraduate degrees in any field with necessary quantitative skills.  Applicants who are familiar with
one or more programming languages and data management (through coursework, work experience, or certifications) may be given priority.
It is anticipated that full-time students may complete the 36 credit hours required for the degree in three (3) semesters (18 months). The MPI program accepts both full time and part time (executive)candidates.
