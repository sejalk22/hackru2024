Undergraduate Seniors

Online Transcript/Degree Navigator Review

Graduating seniors are asked to review their online transcripts to ensure that errors (if any) are caught before certification of diplomas. Students should look for typos, incorrect duplicates of transfer credits/courses, and especially omission of transfer credits/courses. Degree Navigator must be checked regularly to ensure that all degree requirements have been satisfied

Degree Requirements


Students in SAS and SEBS or another professional school should consult their dean’s office regarding their school’s degree requirements.
For students directly admitted to Rutgers by the Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, your undergraduate degree includes:

Completion of the Bloustein School General Education Requirements
Completion of a Bloustein School major program
Completion of a minimum of 120 degree credits
Completion of at least 30 Rutgers credits, including 12 credits within the Bloustein School
Meet the minimum 2.000 cumulative grade-point average




Your Graduation Date

You can find your declared year and month in Degree Navigator on the left panel.  This date is what prompts your record to be included in the senior review. If your date is inaccurate, it must be updated.

Changes can be made via the online Class Year/Graduation Date Change form here. *Direct Admit Students only*
Your graduation date should be firmly declared by the end of the semester before you plan to graduate.
You will be asked to verify the declared graduation date on your record in the fall and spring semesters.


Online Diploma Application


All Bloustein School direct admit undergraduate students who anticipate finishing degree requirements within the coming year must apply online for graduation by the deadline dates listed below.

A student’s “Diploma Name” must match his/her name as it currently appears in the Rutgers Database. Students who wish to have a different name appear on their diploma must submit a “Change of Name Form” along with two forms of evidence that they are already known by the new name (such as a marriage certificate, driver’s license, Court Order, passport, or bank statement).

Students can also inform the school if they will be attending graduation ceremonies and University Commencement; update their email address, phone number, and permanent address, as well as, indicate whether they prefer to have their diploma mailed or picked up in the Registrar’s Office.
