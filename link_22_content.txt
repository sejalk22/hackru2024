The Big Ten Experience




























The Big Ten Experience


Rutgers University–New Brunswick is a proud member of the Big Ten and the NCAA Division I.













          It's More Than Sports
      



Membership in the Big Ten Conference unlocks exclusive opportunities for both students and faculty. The Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) is the athletic league's academic counterpart, made up of 14 top-tier research universities that together conduct $10.5 billion in funded research annually. Rutgers is proud to be a member of this prestigious group.

Big Dreams. Big Plans.
      


Rutgers is committed to building championship contenders in the Big Ten, and so the university has undertaken the R Big Ten Build, raising $100 million to construct premier training facilities for student-athletes from New Jersey, the nation, and around the world.

Progress Through Cooperation
      


When the best minds work together, anything is possible. Through collaborative programs of the BTAA, advances are being made across a wide range of sciences such as alternative energy, life-saving medicine, agriculture, and nutrition. Traveling scholars, summer research, and other opportunities abound. The UBorrow Library Sharing Service enables member schools to partake in one another’s resources for the benefit of all students. CourseShare makes 170+ less commonly taught languages available to students through distance learning.

Current large-scale research collaborations among Big Ten universities include the development of advanced treatment options for wounded servicemen and women, safe nuclear waste cleanup, data analytics for the Department of Homeland Security, and ethical pharmacological bioexploration.

Academic Excellence
      


As a member of the BTAA, Rutgers University is part of a distinguished organization that also includes the University of Illinois, Michigan State, Northwestern, Ohio State, and Purdue. Competitors on the field and collaborators in the classroom, BTAA schools combine their unique strengths to accomplish more than they ever could alone.
