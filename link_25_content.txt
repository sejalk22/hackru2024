Strategic Priorities and Initiatives










Rutgers–New Brunswick is leading the way toward an exceptional future through an ambitious set of initiatives under the umbrella of the Academic Master Plan and its Four Pillars of Excellence: Scholarly Leadership, Innovative Research, Student Success, and Community Engagement. Although Chancellor-priority initiatives are organized by the pillars, the initiatives can fulfill more than one of these four pillars. The initiatives also reflect the president’s vision for the university which included 1) Access and Academic Excellence; 2) Beloved Community; and 3) Common Good.






Academic Master Plan
 
The Rutgers University–New Brunswick Academic Master Plan (AMP), led by the Office of the Chancellor, will serve as the roadmap for the institution’s future, clarifying strategies to accomplish the university’s academic mission. The success of the plan depends on the collaboration and input from our Rutgers–New Brunswick community.
 






Pillar I: Scholarly Leadership
 










          Institute for Teaching, Learning Innovation, and Inclusive Pedagogy
      


The Institute for Teaching, Learning Innovation, and Inclusive Pedagogy (ITLIP) will support effective and inclusive teaching that empowers all students to succeed while at Rutgers and in their future careers. It will provide a space for collaboration, experimentation, and research on innovation in teaching and learning.





ITLIP Task Force Report and Members


In Fall 2022, Chancellor Conway convened a task force to research and develop recommendations for the structure and scope of an Institute for Teaching, Learning, and Inclusive Pedagogy for Rutgers–New Brunswick to support effective teaching.

Graduate Education and Student Support Initiative
The Graduate Education and Student Support Initiative seeks to improve the graduate student experience through enhanced coordination of recruitment, enrollment management, scholarships, academic support, and support for graduate student life. 






Scarlet Guarantee
This signature Rutgers–New Brunswick program aims to make college more accessible and affordable, offering a "last dollar" financial aid award that covers the cost of in-state tuition and mandatory fees. The Scarlet Guarantee is a supplemental program to the Garden State Guarantee.






15+ to Finish
Students can graduate on time and minimize their educational costs if they complete 15 or more credits per semester. The 15+ to Finish initiative helps students get there by connecting them with academic, wellness, and career support services, and opportunities for experiential learning and involvement.









          Nontraditional Learners
      


The Chancellor appointed a committee to investigate the feasibility, need, and scope for a Rutgers–New Brunswick school for nontraditional learners—a group that may include veterans, working students, part-time students, returning students who seek to change majors/careers, students who took time off to work or volunteer, professionals, and/or others. This idea, and the committee’s thorough analysis and conclusions, remain under review.
