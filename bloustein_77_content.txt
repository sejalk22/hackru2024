HISTORY  |  OUR BUILDING  |  FACILITIES







Our History

Established and approved by the Rutgers University Board of Governors in 1992, the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy serves as one of the nation’s key centers for the theory and practice of planning and public policy scholarship and analysis.
Edward J. Bloustein was the seventeenth president of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from New York University and received his law and Ph.D. degrees from Cornell. After teaching at NYU and serving as President of Bennington College, he was appointed President of Rutgers in 1971.
Many observers of higher education believe that, under Dr. Bloustein’s presidency, Rutgers reached a “Golden Age.” His tenure as Rutgers’ president began in the midst of student protests over Vietnam and ended with protests over proposed increases in student tuition, but the intervening years saw the university expand its research facilities, attract internationally known scholars, and achieve distinction as one of the major public research universities in the nation. In February 1989, the university was invited to join 56 other prestigious academic institutions that make up the Association of American Universities. It was this kind of recognition that Edward Bloustein worked so diligently for Rutgers during his 18 years in office. This was the same year in which Dr. Bloustein passed away.

The Civic Square Building
Since 1995, the Bloustein School has been located in the Civic Square Building in downtown New Brunswick. The construction of the Bloustein School’s home realized Dr. Bloustein’s vision that Rutgers University would one day occupy a physical position in the cultural and economic hub of New Brunswick, New Jersey, the host city of Rutgers’ flagship campus.
One of the state’s most significant areas for education, health care, and the arts, New Brunswick is home to Rutgers’ historic Old Queen’s campus; Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Saint Peter’s University Hospital, and the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey. The Bloustein School itself is located in New Brunswick’s thriving cultural area, with The State Theater of New Jersey and the New Brunswick Performing Arts Center just steps away. Downtown New Brunswick offers something for every taste through a spicy menu of restaurants and entertainment venues.
The Civic Square Building epitomized public-private partnership during the city’s redevelopment in 1995, and was financed by nearly equal investments from Rutgers University and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, through the Port Authority’s mandate to promote economic and commercial redevelopment in the region.
The Bloustein School operates state-of-the-art computer laboratories used for both instruction and research. The school’s computing facilities include a main lab, a smaller “information gateway,” and dedicated studio classroom space. The two computer laboratories house 75 computer work stations for students to run software for geoprocessing, statistics, big data analysis, and graphic design.
The computer laboratory is used for graduate class instruction, workshops sponsored by the various centers affiliated with the school, and for professional continuing education. Research projects carried out in the laboratory include student projects, doctoral research analysis, and applied GIS grants and contracts.
The school has also invested over $350,000 in renovations which added an additional 25 workstations and created five “smart classrooms.” Smart classrooms and seminar/conference rooms at the school all feature wireless internet connections and ceiling-mounted projectors with PC, audio and video hook-ups.
