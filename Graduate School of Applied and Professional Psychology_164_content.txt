Professional Licensure Disclosures










Professional Licensure Disclosures
Rutgers University-GSAPP makes every effort to ensure state licensure or certification information is current; however, state requirements may change. If you are planning to pursue professional licensure or certification, it is strongly recommended, and it is the student’s responsibility, to contact the appropriate licensing entity in that state to seek information and guidance regarding licensure or certification requirements before beginning an academic program.
For more information on professional licensure preparation to practice psychology, please contact your program representative:
Clinical PsyD Program (Licensure to practice psychology): Dr. Angelica M. Diaz-Martinez at angelica.diazmartinez@rutgers.edu.
School PsyD Program (Licensure/certification preparation in school psychology): Dr. Jennifer Durham at jdurham@gsapp.rutgers.edu.
Applied Psychology Programs
National Certification in Behavior Analysis: Dr. SungWoo Kahng at s.kahng@rutgers.edu.
Currently NJ licensure to practice Behavior Analysis became law January 2020 and practice regulations are in development.
Certification in Drug and Alcohol Counseling: Dr. Peter Economou at peter.economou@rutgers.edu
Performance Psychology Certification: Dr. Peter Economou at peter.economou@rutgers.edu
License to Practice Psychology. The doctoral programs in Clinical Psychology and School Psychology at GSAPP are accredited by APA (American Psychological Association). APA accreditation is recognized in all 50 states as providing required education for psychology license eligibility. State Boards of Psychology determine training requirements for licensure and typically include post-doctoral training as well as examinations beyond the educational requirements therefore, a doctoral degree from Rutgers University-GSAPP in Clinical Psychology or School Psychology is not sufficient to meet licensure requirements in most states. Students should confirm state licensing requirements directly with the state they are interested in licensure. ASPPB (Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards) provides a compendium called PsyBook which summarizes requirements for each state that may be a helpful resource for students determining vocational location and licensing requirements.
Generally, the way licensure to practice psychology works is (1) complete an approved education program. APA accredited programs are recognized in all states although some states impose additional education and training requirements; (2) complete a full-time one-year internship (Internship is a requirement for the degree if you are in an APA accredited program such as GSAPP’s doctoral programs. Note: Students in the school program also have the option of doing an internship that does not have APA approval); (3) complete a 1-year post-doctoral fellowship (i.e., this can be a formal post-doctoral fellowship or work experience in which you are supervised by a board approved licensed psychologist) with supervised clinical experience under the appropriate license or registration for the state you are located in (please note, some states do not require a post-doc). However, some states (e.g., Maryland) are beginning to count pre-doctoral hours towards the total number of hours required for licensure; (4) take the national (EPPP—Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology) and state examinations required; (5) complete any additional requirements for the state you are seeking licensure in (typically background checks, credential verifications, some states have juris prudence exams and some have additional specific training requirements as well).
Rutgers University - GSAPP produces graduates who are successfully licensed to practice psychology in many states. To the best of our knowledge, no GSAPP graduate has been turned down for licensure due to insufficiencies in the education and training GSAPP provides. As noted above some states do have additional training and education requirements and most states have post-doctoral clinical supervision requirements as well.
Because we are a State University of the State of New Jersey, our curriculum for the Doctor of Psychology degree complies with the State of New Jersey’s curriculum licensing requirements.
The ASPPB website also provides Psychology Licensure Requirements on their website for Psychologist, School Psychologist and Behavior Analyst which can be found at http://psybook.asppb.org/. You should directly check the web sites of the State Licensing Board you are interested in for the most accurate and up to date information on educational and other requirements for licensure as there is no guarantee that ASPPB’s is entirely accurate and up to date. Licensing boards may change requirements at any time with no notice to training programs.
For your convenience,  below are state by state listing of our recent understanding of educational requirements based largely on the annual review by ASPPB to give you a general idea of how well Rutgers Clinical PsyD Program, School PsyD Program, and Applied Behavior Analyst Program at GSAPP fits with the educational requirements of each state.
