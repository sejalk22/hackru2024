In an ongoing effort to expand our outreach and delivery of CE credits to additional populations, we've partnered with a number of reputable organizations. These collaborative trainings are produced by those organizations and CE credits are provided by OPDCE.  We're grateful for these partnerships and the opportunity to offer CE credits to an even greater network of professionals.  Check back often for updates!
