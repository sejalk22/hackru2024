          Overview
      


Our academic programs extend and deepen disciplined knowledge of psychology - from its biological aspects, through the psychology of individual and group processes, to organizations and social systems. In keeping with GSAPP's philosophy of training, most courses require an experiential component that allows continuous integration of course work with supervised experience. In this way, our students become competent in professional practitioner skills of assessment, intervention, and evaluation.
