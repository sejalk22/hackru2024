Undergraduate Funding and Fellowships

The Bloustein School encourages undergraduate students to contact the Office of Financial Aid for more information about federal and state aid as well as Federal Work Study programs. Also, as part of Governor Phil Murphy’s commitment to improving college affordability, the university provides “last dollar” financial aid awards via the Garden State Guarantee and the Rutgers-New Brunswick Scarlet Guarantee.

Garden State Guarantee
The Garden State Guarantee  (GSG) is New Jersey’s promise to make a college degree more accessible and affordable. By reducing out-of-pocket costs for students and families, New Jersey is limiting the amount of debt that residents must borrow to attend an in-state, public college or university. Students who have earned 60 credits or greater are evaluated for GSG eligibility.
See all eligibility requirements here.

Scarlet Guarantee
The Scarlet Guarantee is a signature Rutgers–New Brunswick program designed to make college more accessible and affordable, offering a “last dollar” financial aid award that covers the cost of in-state tuition and mandatory fees for qualified students who have earned less than 60 credits. Together with the Garden State Guarantee, these programs provide a transformational opportunity for students that will bridge the gap in resources needed to start and finish their higher education.
