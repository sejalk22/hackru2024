Prospective Graduate Students







2024 Admitted Graduate Students Open House: March 27 & 28, 2024. Virtual and in-person options.

RSVP Now





Admission to Bloustein School graduate programs is competitive. Prospective students are individuals who have graduated from approved institutions and who show evidence of potential for successful completion of a graduate program. Qualified students to some of our programs may be eligible for need- or merit-based financial aid. The Bloustein School also offers research and practicum opportunities through the wide variety of centers and institutes housed within the school.
Please note that the GRE has been waived for ALL MASTER’S applications seeking admission for fall / September 2024 intake.
The diverse student body at the Bloustein School is comprised of individuals who desire to make a difference in critical planning, public policy, community health, and related areas. Our students come from throughout the United States as well as many countries around the globe.
Interested in speaking with one of our student recruiters? Email recruit@ejb.rutgers.edu

Admissions & Application Process

Connecting Students with Graduate Programs
Thinking about graduate school? The Bloustein School worked with Idealist on their Grad School 101 video series. The video series complements the Idealist Grad Fairs, and strives to help prospective students navigate the graduate school application and financial aid process.

Watch the Video

Idealist.org helps connect prospective graduate students with public-interest / social impact graduate programs, and recently created a video highlighting their Grad Schools directory. Graduate schools join and create profiles with program information, application requirements, and enrollment data to tell candidates what they need to know about their programs. Prospective students can access this information in one location and use filters to tailor their grad school search to their specific needs.
