Rutgers and GSAPP: A Powerhouse Connection



Research at Rutgers University transforms lives, improves communities, and advances society. 
GSAPP is proud to be at the forefront of research, innovation, and collaboration. Our research aligns with the Rutgers mission and vision and contributes to our overall academic excellence and reputation as a thought change leader in the field of applied and professional psychology. Since our inception a half-century ago, GSAPP researchers have generated and disseminated knowledge using contemporary, disciplined approaches and methodologies. We are committed to exploring leading-edge, cost-effective initiatives and opportunities to advance humanity and strengthen our position as the gold standard in schools of professional psychology. We have a particular focus on work that serves underserved populations and benefits the common good.
The collaborative nature of our research facilitates multidisciplinary partnerships. Leveraging collective strengths and resources, we are truly better together.  Team members’ unique backgrounds, skills, talents, and specialty areas of expertise contribute to our diversity of thought and success, amplifying our ability to elevate GSAPP's mission, vision, and legacy.














A Culture of Curiosity 



At GSAPP, we foster a culture of curiosity. Faculty, staff, and students are enthusiastically encouraged and supported to pursue lifelong learning and discovery. Our faculty members publish copiously, serving in principal  investigative roles and continuously exploring innovative concepts. We conduct systemic studies that generate insightful, evidence-based conclusions with tangible, sustainable impact. We adopt novel approaches to solve complex problems.
Our research pushes boundaries to influence policy decisions and drive progress in psychotherapy, wellness, autism and other developmental disorders, substance use, behavior analysis, school climate, social-emotional learning, the youth mental health care crisis, and more. Our studies articulate advancements and inequities in all areas of mental health care assessments, treatments, and education. We use the latest technology and methodologies to pursue areas of research that benefit individuals, groups, communities, marginalized/vulnerable populations, and society-at-large.
