Career Development for Undergraduate Students







Undergraduate majors in Bloustein School programs undertake a comprehensive and thorough set of capstone professional practice courses on “Internship” and “Leadership” which hold weekly/biweekly seminars covering many career development-oriented topics.  Resume, cover letter, LinkedIn, project management, and internship/employment search are among some of those covered.  In-depth research within the field of study as well as strengthening professional skill sets are also engaged.
The Bloustein School faculty serve as a tremendous resource for undergraduate students seeking advice and counsel on the practice within their field.  A wide range of practitioners teach in the programs coming from key industry, government, and non-profit sectors.  Leaders from the health, planning, and policy professions engage students in their courses and they should be encouraged to speak to them about careers in the field.
In addition to the instruction provided at the Bloustein School, students should also consult with the Rutgers University Office of Career Exploration and Success (CES)  for information on reviewing interview techniques, other job opportunities, and various employment support services. Individual counseling is also available to both students and alumni.
CES offers a variety of workshops and programs to address various career development topics. Some fall programs that might be of interest to you include:

Drop-In Resume Clinic
How To: Prepare for an In-Person Career Fair
Career Exploration Night
Pursuing an Internship/Job in Corporate America with a Social Sciences Degree
Navigating the Graduate School Application Process  

For workshop dates, times, and registration, students should visit the “Events” section of Rutgers Handshake.
Additionally, RU Handshake provides access to thousands of job and internship listings, the ability to schedule appointments with career advisers, read employer reviews from other students, network with employers, register for career events, access exclusive online resources, and much more.
CES uses a career development model focused on career communities. This model allows students to break out of the confines of viewing career opportunities based on majors and opens the door to more career options.

Part-Time Student Jobs on Campus


The Student Employment Office (SEO) administers two employment programs for students: the Federal Work Study Program (FWSP) and the Job Location and Development Program (JLDP). The FWSP is offered to financial aid recipients who meet certain criteria; the JLDP is available to all currently-enrolled university students.
Eligible students can work in a variety of on-campus jobs, such as in campus centers, recreation centers, libraries, and University departments. Additionally, students can work in on-campus and off-campus paid community service positions for non-profit agencies and organizations in areas related to education and literacy, human and social services, law and public policy, arts and humanities, multicultural, diversity and social justice, health and business.
