Graduate Program


Korea Development Institute (KDI) Scholars Program







In January 2001, the Bloustein School entered into a partnership to accept students from the School of Public Policy and Management of the Korea Development Institute (KDI) into the Master of City and Regional Studies (MCRS) degree program.  In 2016, the school began accepting applicants into its Master of Public Affairs and Politics (MPAP) degree in public policy as well.
The KDI School of Public Policy and Management was established in 1998 to meet the educational needs of government and business leaders in a globalizing world economy. The school is a collaborative effort between the Korea Development Institute, founded 30 years ago as Korea’s premier policy research organization, and the Korean government. Classes at the KDI School, which attracts students from Asia and around the world, are conducted in English. Approximately 40 percent of the student body is comprised of international students. As part of their two‐year masters course, KDI School students are required to spend one year at an overseas university.
Rutgers and the Bloustein School are very well known in Korean academic and planning/policy circles, and offer KDI students an excellent opportunity to broaden their knowledge and practical skills through the combination of coursework and professional internship. Approximately 8-15 students arrive each spring to spend a year at the Bloustein School and immerse themselves in the MCRS and/or MPAP degree programs.
 






Degree Program Admission/Student Selection
KDI school students apply to the Bloustein School’s Master of City and Regional Studies (MCRS) or Master of Public Affairs and Politics (MPAP), a one‐year program of study in planning and policy development and in public policy. The  purpose of the programs are to offer selected students at KDI the chance to study policy, public affairs, city and regional planning and development, obtaining a  master’s degree and concentrate in a field of interest.
Scholars apply to the program on an annual basis and will be selected based upon standard admission criteria. Scholars are admitted to the spring term semester to begin the program and continue for one calendar year, taking courses in the summer and fall terms as well.
Applications to the MCRS and MPAP degrees must be completed ONLINE and all hard copies of supporting documents sent to:
