          Doctorate of Organizational Psychology (PsyD)
      


The Doctoral Program (PsyD) in Organizational Psychology embodies a scholar-practitioner model bridging theory and science with applied psychology. The program is delivered in a hybrid manner, including mostly online coursework with on-the-ground training opportunities (although some students may also complete virtual training at various sites). Students have an option to develop a course plan to meet their personal, professional, and academic goals. 




















          What We Do?
      


The practice of organizational psychology consists of intervening with organizations to achieve one or more of the following objectives:
Raise performance
Improve processes and relationships
Enhance fairness and equity
Increase subjective well-being
Organizational psychologists work within the context of organizations, although interventions may focus on individuals, pairs of individuals, groups, combinations of groups, or whole organizations. Methods of intervention derive from explicit psychological concepts and theories appropriate to the objectives and entities engaged in change processes. When fully utilized, the practice of organizational psychology begins with assessment or diagnosis, proceeds to design and implementation, and concludes with evaluation of the efforts to bring about change. Organizational psychology is practiced with service-delivering and product-generating organizations from the public, private, and not-for-profit sectors of society.

          Our Students
      


Our students have the opportunity to participate in practical, impactful work. This collaborative edition of an instrumental e-newsletter for the underserved adult autistic community focused on Wellness and Well-being. Spearheaded by two GSAPP Org Psych doctoral students, it provided beneficial information and resources about mindfulness and effective ways to deal with stress in the workplace and in one’s personal life.
"The flexibility, diversity, and freedom are just a few of the many aspects I admire about GSAPP. I am so thankful to be able to stay in state to attend graduate school at Rutgers. It seems fitting for me to continue my education where I finished undergrad. There are real world opportunities here, and I was actually able to secure a sports psychology internship that can both provide experience and count towards my studies. The faculty is always kind and resourceful when it comes to helping me navigate my way through school." - Luke Nathan, Organizational Psychology, Class of 2025 
Check out this special edition of Organizational Development Review. An article about organizational trauma was written by student, Adam Ben-Hanania, MA, ABD, Organizational Psychology, Class of 2024, and the entire issue was guest edited by faculty member, Preston Lindsay, PhD.
