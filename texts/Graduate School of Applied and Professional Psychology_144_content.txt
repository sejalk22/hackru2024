“Looking at GSAPP, once I watched their faculty videos, Rutgers jumped to the top of my list of schools. There are two things that I will always stay close to—working with the veteran population, because it’s near and dear to my heart, and the autistic population as well. I’m excited to make a difference and improve the lives of those in underserved populations. Everyone here is making impactful change happen. I’m inspired and honored to be a part of it.” - Dan Muhlbach: Clinical Psychology PsyD, class of 2026

Financial Aid 






Rutgers University
The cost of a graduate/advanced degree can be expensive, which is why Rutgers University offers a variety of financial aid opportunities for all students. Please note that GSAPP is NOT involved in the RU-OFA financial aid process. For questions and detailed information, please visit the Office of Financial Aid (OFA)’s Rutgers Scarlet Hub.
GSAPP-Specific
GSAPP's academic programs are primarily self-funded. Rutgers GSAPP (see Tuition and Fees) offers limited funding opportunities for students. Students may receive financial aid assistance that is merit-based, need-based, or non-need based. The level of support awarded is dependent on the specific graduate program and degree status. Learn more about program-specific aid available to current students.
 












FAQs 









          Pre-Application Preparation
      





Can I apply without having completed all my prerequisite courses?


Yes, if an applicant is accepted and chooses to attend a program, they are expected to complete their outstanding prerequisite requirements prior to beginning class in the fall semester. Prerequisites can be completed at an accredited institution. 




Is a Master's Degree required for admission to a PsyD program?


No, a student can apply to any of our doctoral programs directly from having earned a bachelor’s degree. In some cases, a Master’s degree is advised as a good way for prospective applicants to develop more experience (both clinical and research) in the field.




Do I have to have a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Psychology in order to apply and be accepted to your Master’s or Doctoral programs?


No, Rutgers Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology accepts and considers applications from applicants of diverse academic backgrounds. However, for all applicants from non-psychology (or other related fields) academic backgrounds, we require that they fulfill all listed prerequisite courses prior to the first day of class, if accepted.

No. However, all applicants are expected to have taken approximately 15 undergraduate credits in psychology, including statistics, experimental and abnormal. Other prerequisites apply.
