          Beyond the Classroom
      


Research is the vital link between scholarship and society. It’s where theory meets practice, and problems find solutions. Simply put, research paves the way for transformative evolution and key developments. At GSAPP, it enables the integration of scientific knowledge with modernization in the delivery of psychological services.
Expanding our reach and recognition, our award-winning faculty share their latest findings and best practices across external and internal networks and with a broad scholarly and public audience -  in workshops, at conferences, with the media, and more.
