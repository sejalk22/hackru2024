Answer













          Sex Ed, Honestly
      



Answer, established in 1981 as the New Jersey Network for Family Life Education, was largely shaped during the 23-year tenure of Susan N. Wilson, MS.Ed. From its inception, Answer has provided high-quality training to teachers and other youth-serving professionals. In 1994, we began using the power of peer-to-peer communication to offer sexuality education directly to teens through our award-winning, teen-written Sex, Etc. magazine and website.













          For Professionals
      


We believe sexuality educators and other youth-serving professionals are important to young people’s health. Sexuality can be a challenging subject to teach. Answer is here to help by providing online workshops and webinars, lesson plans and other resources that can support you in this critical role.
There are lots of resources that can help you become more comfortable and confident talking with youth. The youth that look up to you are looking for answers, so talk early and talk often.




  Certificate in Adolescent Sex Education Basics 





















          For Teens
      


Answer provides young people with unfettered access to honest, accurate sexuality education.
Our award-winning, teen-written Sex, Etc. website reaches teens nationwide with accurate sexual health information.
No matter where teens are or how technology changes, Sex, Etc. will always be there to teach them about their bodies, relationships, birth control, safer sex and other sexual health topics.




















          For Parents
      


We believe parents are the most important sex educators for their children. It can be tough to talk about sex with your own children. Answer is here to help by providing links to books, organizations, Web sites, and workshops that can support you in this critical role.
There are lots of resources that can help you become more comfortable and confident talking with your children. Your children want to hear from you, so talk early and talk often.
