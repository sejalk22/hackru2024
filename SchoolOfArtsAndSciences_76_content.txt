Student Housing and Dining


A range of housing and dining options await you at Rutgers University–New Brunswick.













          Your Home Away from Home
      



Rutgers University–New Brunswick provides students with a variety of housing options across its five campuses. Each offers a distinct living experience ranging from large, lively residence halls to smaller, more intimate houses. Whichever you choose, you’ll be a short walk or bus ride from all that Rutgers has to offer.













          Residence Halls
      


Across its five interconnected campuses, Rutgers–New Brunswick operates one of the largest collegiate housing programs in the country, with more than 50 housing options. That brings a lot of choices and with it the camaraderie of residence halls shared by your fellow students with similar academic interests. Discover which one is right for you.

          More Than A Room
      


A dormitory is so much more than a place to crash after a long day of studying. On-campus life opens a world of new experiences: bonding with your roommates, sharing a late-night bite, or hanging with your new friends down the hall.
























    Choosing Your Dorm Impacts University Experience
  




















          Living-Learning Communities
      


Living-learning communities allow like-minded students to live in the same residence hall, building social and academic networks in and out of the classroom. These self-selected groups share similar interests and make meaningful connections with students and faculty for a more rewarding academic experience. The different offerings include:
Asian American Identities and Images
Business Discovery House
Entrepreneurship and Innovation
French Language and Culture
Health and Medicine International
Law and Political Science Discovery House
Latin Images
Leadership
Nourish (Wellness)
Paul Robeson (African Diaspora)
Psychology Discovery House
RU-tv Weather Watchers

          Interest-Based Residency
      


Rutgers' interest-based or thematic residencies include Douglass Residential College and Honors College, a community built on shared respect and responsibility with an emphasis on diversity. Here we encourage any student in need of support to call upon us.

Magic Food Card
      


Here's a tasty fact: Rutgers Dining Services is the third-largest student dining operation in the country—responsible for feeding all five residential campuses at Rutgers–New Brunswick—and meal plans are an essential part of that. Every student with a meal plan receives a complimentary reusable bag and bottle as part of Dining Services' efforts to "feed people, not landfills."







    Rutgers Meal Plans
  


Meal plans are “block plans,” meaning that you decide in advance the number of meals you think you’ll need for the semester. Plans are available for students living on or off-campus.




  Learn More About Meal Plans 






    RU Express
  


You can use the Rutgers ID card as a university debit card with RU Express, which allows you to purchase meals at both on-campus and off-campus locations, with online ordering available.

          Meal Options By Campus
      


Whether you’re a first-year student new to meal plans or a grad student on the prowl for a late-night snack, Rutgers has you covered with a bounty of delicious choices when you’re looking for a meal or just a bite to satisfy the munchies on any campus.

          Tasty and Nutritious
      


Although Rutgers Dining Services prepares 35,000 meals daily (6.9M each year), you might be pleasantly surprised by the high quality of our menu options: Dishes are co-curated by the Culinary Institute of America with sustainability in mind.
