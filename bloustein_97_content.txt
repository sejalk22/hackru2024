Scholarships, Financial Aid, and Student Work Opportunities







ABOUT  |  SCHOLARSHIPS  |  FELLOWSHIPS |  WORK OPPORTUNITIES







The Bloustein School offers merit-based funding to certain graduate program applicants in a variety of formats during the admissions process. This may include tuition awards, scholarships, fellowships and assistantships, and a variety of hourly work assignments. Applicants are considered for funding based upon faculty review of their full graduate application. Individual programs and program directors make recommendations on supporting candidates based upon those faculty evaluations. There is no separate application for these scholarships.
The Bloustein School Dean’s Office makes all final offers of aid after recommendations have been made. Nearly all awards are offered to full-time students. There are some small endowed awards that are provided to part-time students. It is important to note that not all students will receive offers. Funds available will only cover a portion of all applicants.
Federal and state loans and grants are not a part of this process. You should contact the Rutgers Financial Aid Office for more information on these opportunities.
Research centers and institutes and individual faculty also provide assistantships and hourly work opportunities for graduate students.
A very limited number of scholarships and fellowships are available for students in Bloustein School undergraduate majors. Opportunities listed below are denoted with (*). Undergraduates are encouraged to contact the Rutgers Financial Aid Office for more information about federal and state loans and Federal Work Study programs.
