Course Catalogs


Rutgers catalogs serve as the source for degree and major requirements, as well as academic policies and procedures. Most catalogs are available in a searchable online format. They are typically updated on a two-year cycle. Rutgers online catalogs are environmentally friendly, enabling students to print information as needed. Archived print catalogs are maintained in university libraries.
