There are many easy ways for you to help keep our campus safe.
Sign up for text alerts to receive emergency updates (NetID required).
Stay alert and aware of people and your surroundings.
Avoid alcohol/drugs: Persons under the influence are much more likely to become victims.
Immediately notify Rutgers University Police of any suspicious person or activity.
Know your route before you go, checking the online campus map.
After dark, walk with others. Use well-lighted paths. Study with friends.
Use university transportation and walking chaperone services. Never hitchhike or pick up hitchhikers.
Do not prop open any building doors.
Keep your dorm door locked. Make sure first-floor windows, fire escape windows, and security screens are locked.
Do not allow strangers into residence buildings.
Do not leave property unattended.
