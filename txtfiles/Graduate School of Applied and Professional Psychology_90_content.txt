Each fall, CYSEW holds a free virtual "Seminar Series" on a biweekly basis. The most recent seminar series is posted here, and the next fall series will be released this summer.
Youth mental health leaders from academia, nonprofits, and advocacy institutions led research presentations, community dialogues, and workshop/trainings on diverse topic areas. These ranged from immigration-related trauma & its clinical implications to culturally responsive service provision to social determinants of youth mental health.
