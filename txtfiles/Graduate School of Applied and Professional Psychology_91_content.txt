          Collaborative Relationships
      


On April 27th, 2023, 135 Rutgers students, staff, faculty, and community members came together for the inaugural CYSEW Youth Mental Health Equity Summit to develop collaborative relationships and share ideas about youth mental health equity in New Jersey.
Attendees heard from a variety of speakers - including Rutgers GSAPP faculty, a panel of adolescents and young adults on their challenges and needs, and a panel of foundations that fund research and mental health service implementation in NJ. As well, attendees worked to identify solutions for addressing barriers youth and families face when seeking evidence-based mental health care, prevention, and wellness services.
The CYSEW team worked to identify themes from the summit activities to serve as a roadmap for collaboration, strategic planning, and financial support. Coding responses led to the identification of four barriers and solutions and several specific actions designed to support each solution. The specific action items listed below are examples and are not intended to be an exhaustive list.
Summit attendees were welcomed to submit CYSEW grant proposals for different action steps tied to one of the four themes. We were grateful for the time, effort, and thought attendees put into identifying ways to improve the wellness and mental health care system.
We want to thank our primary event sponsor, the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, APA Division 53, Child Mental Health in Action Award (Click for more information).
















As part of the Summit, CYSEW offers attendees the opportunity to apply for grant funding to expand community/Rutgers partnerships to address mental health equity in NJ. An innovative model of funding has been developed that requires partnership between two or more community organizations or institutions.
For the 2023 Summit, CYSEW was able to fund two exciting new collaborations between Rutgers and community organizations:
Project 1: CYSEW funded a partnership between Rutgers-New Brunswick, the Urban Health Collaborative, and the National Alliance on Mental Illness-New Jersey (NAMI-NJ). This project seeks to improve access to mental health services in Middlesex and Somerset counties. The team is using a community-based participatory research approach to conduct a comprehensive needs assessment of behavioral health services that will identify service gaps and develop solutions to fill those gaps. Overall, the project will gather feedback from over 300 community members, informing Rutgers, the Urban Health Collective, and NAMI about the most effective ways to provide evidence-based services in Middlesex and Somerset counties.
	 
Project 2: CYSEW funded a partnership between Rutgers-Camden, the Mercer County Traumatic Loss Coalition, and the Chosen Inspiration Association, a nonprofit organization that inspires teens to overcome adversity, pursue dreams, and become community leaders. Chosen Inspiration Association sought to address Barrier #2 identified at the summit – lack of information and open communication. Chosen Inspiration is hosting the Break the Silence: Suicide Prevention and Awareness Symposium to be held in Trenton, NJ. This two day symposium focuses on empowering youth and families to prevent self-harm. The event includes expert speakers presenting about grief, suicide prevention strategies, bullying, depression, and anxiety. The symposium will serve to reduce stigma around depression and suicide and foster collaboration in Trenton around service provision.
CYSEW congratulates these award winners and looks forward to funding additional collaborations in 2024!






 
Barrier 1: Limited integration across community organizations, schools, and colleges/universities creates a confusing system that is difficult to navigate. 
Solution 1: Increase collaboration to develop interconnected systems of care and researcher/community partnerships that will increase access and continuity of high-quality mental health care.
Expand call centers designed to provide clear guidance to parents/caregivers on where to find services. Call centers must have knowledge of insurance options, specific areas of expertise, and current wait times.
Move away from the current “one and done” treatment model by better-coordinating tiered systems of care. Clearly identify service paths that facilitate youth seamlessly moving from wellness and prevention services to treatment services and back again. 
Increase the frequency of cross-disciplinary and cross-organization collaborative community events. Events are needed at the broad NJ level and at the regional level. 
Foundations and other funders should focus on supporting community/researcher partnerships that involve multiple types of community agencies along with researchers to evaluate implementation and outcomes. 
Organize summit attendees and the broader community to advocate for strong reimbursement models for integrating mental health care into school, pediatric, and community settings and for the expansion of telehealth reimbursement.
 
Barrier 2: Lack of information and open communication about wellness and mental health leads to stigma and confusion about when and how to seek support.
Solution 2: Increase education and empowerment opportunities for teachers, parents, youth, and others who frequently interact with youth (e.g., pediatricians, religious leaders, etc.). 
Develop events similar to the summit but for parents and youth to provide collaborative opportunities to engage, support, and learn. 
Empower parents and teachers by providing them with the information needed to talk openly and knowledgably with youth about wellness and mental health. 
Increase mental health education in schools to normalize communication and reduce stigma.
Encourage and facilitate youth-led social media campaigns around wellness and mental health.
Develop workshops that provide practical and realistic wellness and mental health communication strategies and specific language for parents and teachers to use.
 
Barrier 3: Structural and financial barriers lead to an inadequate wellness/mental health workforce. 
Solution 3: Reduce financial and licensing barriers to mental health careers in NJ and develop additional wellness focused applied bachelors or masters level degrees and certificates. 
Advocate to make mental health licensing processes in NJ less costly and burdensome. NY process/rules noted as a potential model.
Increase financial support for students pursuing education to enter the mental health workforce. This could include fellowships that require commitment to work in a particular NJ community while training and for a set period of time post-graduation.
Increase bachelor’s, certificate, and master’s level opportunities that are applied in nature and provide training in evidence-based wellness and prevention programs and strategies.
Rapidly scale-up integrated models of mental health care by increasing cross-disciplinary training programs that teach providers to deliver holistic treatment in multiple types of organizations.
Expand insurance reimbursement options for wellness and prevention services delivered by providers at all levels (e.g., bachelors to doctoral). 
 
Barrier 4: Focus on treatment and crisis intervention, while critical, leads to missed opportunities to promote wellbeing and resilience.
Solution 4: Expansion of community and school wellness activities, particularly clubs and events that empower and support youth to advocate and lead. 
In schools and communities, explicitly focus on fostering positive peer relationships and interactions to combat rapidly rising rates of loneliness and isolation. 
Develop curriculum where teachers/professors openly discuss wellness challenges, stress, and coping strategies and model caring for others health and wellness as part of education. 
Expand wellness/mental health focused school/community youth-led projects, clubs, and events that empower youth to take on leadership and advocacy roles. 
Develop additional peer-to-peer programs that provide financial support for youth who receive training and lead advocacy efforts and support groups.
 
“It’s time we change the narrative, shift the dialogue, and combat the stigma surrounding mental health issues, particularly among our nation’s youth.” - Schuyler DeBree - Website | Podcast
