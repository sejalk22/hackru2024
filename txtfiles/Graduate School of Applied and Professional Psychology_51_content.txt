          Student - Faculty Connection
      


Louise Athens, MAP graduate, Class of 2023, on Dr. Deirdre Waters - "I learned so much from Dr. Waters, about the powerful modality, ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy), establishing client trust, and more. During my practicum, she was very open to hearing the student perspective, empowering us to establish alliances with our clients, which built our confidence as future mental health practitioners. She was a phenomenal professor, mentor, and supervisor." 
Dr. Deirdre Waters, Director of Master of Applied Psychology (MAP) program, on Louise Athens: “Louise is recognized as a smart and engaged student in the classroom, a compassionate and skilled clinician on practicum, and a fun and supportive friend among her cohort. I am confident that she will make a significant impact in the field of psychology, and I am excited for her as she pursues her doctoral studies post-graduation from the Applied Psychology Department.”
