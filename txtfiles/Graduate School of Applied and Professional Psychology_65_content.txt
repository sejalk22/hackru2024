          What is MTSS?
      


Pioneered by scholars in education and school psychology, Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) is a framework for providing comprehensive academic and behavioral health services for K-12 students. Use of this framework has been strongly advocated by school systems, policymakers, and researchers at the state and national levels. To effectively implement MTSS, school districts may need to provide more comprehensive school-wide programming that requires additional professional development to build or expand their efforts. Training in MTSS Is more essential than ever for Teachers, Academic Coaches, Instructional Leaders, School Counselors, School Psychologists, Child Study Team Members and Administrators to address the ongoing academic and behavior health needs of students.




















          Why MTSS?
      


Now, more than ever, students approach school with vastly different learning, social emotional, and behavioral needs. Teachers, specialists, and other professionals in school settings need knowledge and tools to help them identify students’ learning and social emotional needs to implement evidence-based practices that are closely linked to those needs.
MTSS Enables:
Rapid, strategic identification of student needs
Matching intensity of interventions to the level of student need
Ongoing progress monitoring
Data-Driven Decision-Making
Equitable Intervention Access for ALL students
Benefits of Specialized Training in MTSS:
Become a leader in change within your school systems
Gain background and technical knowledge and expertise in MTSS – know what to do, how to do it, and the science behind it
Improve the delivery of academic, social, behavioral and mental health services
Career advancement:
	Take on systems-level roles and become a leader in your district
Innovate progress in assessment, instruction, and support services in school settings






















          MTSS: A Framework for Improving the Delivery of Student Support Services
      


Intensive Individual Intervention
Includes individualized intensive instruction/intervention when students demonstrate the need for a higher level of support than previously offered. Students’ needs are highly specific and often require direct one-to-one support, frequent monitoring, and coordination across supports.
Targeted Group Intervention
Includes small group instruction/intervention when students demonstrate the need for support beyond prevention programming. Students are typically identified through a screening process to determine what additional support is needed.
Universal Prevention
Includes core instruction, social emotional learning, and school-wide positive behavior supports. All Tier 1, every student has access to schoolwide and classroom prevention programming.




















          Admissions and Coursework
      


GSAPP offers two convenient, fully online learning paths: an 18-credit certificate program and a 30-credit master’s degree in applied psychology focused exclusively on MTSS in school settings. These programs have been designed for current or future professionals in education (e.g., general or special educators, instructional leaders, administrators, counselors, psychologists, or other support professionals) who are looking to become change agents in their schools or districts.
Please Note: The MAP-MTSS Program is not a master’s degree in School Psychology.

          MTSS Certificate Course Sequence (18 Credits) 
      





18:820:525 - Prevention and Intervention in Tiered Systems (Fall, 3 Credits) 


The purpose of this course is to provide students with an in-depth introduction to the foundational concepts and recent history of Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) in primary and secondary school settings. Students will learn of the rationale behind and intend outcomes of multi-tiered systems of support in K-12 settings; how these systems are often organized and function; and critically, how schools begin the process of designing and implementing their own MTSS. Students will be exposed to topics of assessment, data-based decision making, and intervention strategies across contexts, as well as organizational strategies to promote implementation. Subsequent courses will cover each of these areas in greater depth and will provide opportunities for greater development of skill and expertise. By participating in this course, students will have the foundational knowledge required to begin help their school systems begin to evaluate the range of support currently available and identify future implementation needs. 




18:820:526 - Assessment and Data-Based Decision Making (Spring, 3 Credits)


The purpose of this course is to provide students with the foundational knowledge and applied skills required to engage in multiple forms of assessment used within MTSS frameworks, and to use data collected from such assessments to guide decision making and consultation at the individual and systems levels. This course will help students learn the basics of psychometrics, assessment (focused primarily on curriculum-based, or general outcome measurement), and will familiarize students with current best-practices in data-based decision making. It is expected that students completing this course will be able to translate findings from research into data practices that guide and improve support for all learners.




18:820:535 - Behavioral and Systems Consultation (Fall, 3 Credits) 


Successful implementation of MTSS often requires multiple forms of ongoing consultation by individuals with technical knowledge and skills in guiding others through a process of problem-solving and professional development. The purpose of this course is to build skills that will enable provision of consultation to enhance the quality of assessment, decision making, and intervention practices, and also to build upon developing skill in consultation around planning and initial implementation of MTSS.




18:820:533 - Data-Based Decision Making for Intervention in Early Reading Skills (Spring, 3 Credits)


One of the largest barriers to effective implementation of MTSS is knowing how to intervene, and with which interventions. Informed by the latest science, as well as field-based experience, this course has been designed to offer in-depth training on reading interventions for the elementary grades. Course participants will gain expertise in the science of learning to read, and in evidence-based reading intervention. Lessons will cover how to determine which students require intervention, the nature of each student’s skill-based needs, and how to use data to find interventions that target those needs.
NOTE: This course requires a weekly, virtual, one-hour synchronous learning session with the instructor. 




15:293:523 (GSE) - Teaching in Inclusive Classrooms (Spring, 3 Credits)


The focus of this course is on the role of the inclusive classroom within the context of MTSS prevention models. The purpose is to prepare professionals to implement strategies in inclusive settings to promote school success, such as high-quality culturally-responsive instructional practices (i.e., best practice and motivationally engaging instructional strategies and evidence-based interventions) across the core content areas; high leverage practices to cultivate a positive inclusive classroom climate; methods of identifying students who are at-risk and curriculum-based measurement to monitor progress and adapt instruction and interventions effectively.
Note: Students must register for Dr. Judy Harrison’s section in the Graduate School of Education)




15:293:TBD (GSE) - Classroom Organization for Inclusive and Special Classrooms (Fall, 3 Credits)


The focus of this course is on classroom and behavior management, delivered in the context of MTSS programming. Course content is drawn from a multidisciplinary research base, and covers a continuum, including working within a range of school environments that leverage an MTSS framework to varying degrees; establishing a positive and productive learning environment; building and facilitating positive relationships, proactive data-based assessment and management of behavioral issues. 












          Master of Applied Psychology (MAP) in MTSS Course Sequence (30 Credits) 
      





18:820:525 - Prevention and Intervention in Tiered Systems (Fall, 3 Credits)

18:820:610 - Seminar in Professional Psychology: Using MTSS to Build Comprehensive School-Based Mental Health Services (Spring, 3 Credits)


The purpose of this course is to provide students with the foundational knowledge and applied skills required to develop comprehensive school-based mental health (CSBMH) programs using a MTSS framework. This course will provide an overview of MTSS and facilitate students' understanding of key components of well-developed CSBMH programs. The course will highlight the importance of developing prevention and intervention programming focused on using social emotional learning to build evidence-based prevention and intervention programs. Readings and assignments will challenge students to explore issues of diversity, equity and inclusion and their influence on systemic change. Students will also begin to develop their understanding of school systems and the steps required to implement sustainable CSBMH programs. It is expected that students completing this course will be able to translate findings from research into implementation practices that guide and improve the delivery of mental health services.
