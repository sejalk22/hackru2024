          Overview
      


The Office of Professional Development and Continuing Education (OPDCE) is a division of Rutgers Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology (GSAPP) that is devoted to the professional development of psychologists, social workers, students, teachers, counselors, and other mental health professionals and certificate holders. It works collaboratively with Rutgers Division of Continuing Studies and is part of the Continuing Education Coordinating Council (CECC).
OPDCE strives to meet the training needs of licensed psychologists and other behavioral health professionals through continuing education (CE), non-matriculation, certificate, and advanced professional training programs in a variety of formats.

Many of these trainings and workshops provide CE credits to practitioners that will comply with regulations set forth by governing bodies such the American Psychological Association (APA), the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP), and/or Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB).
