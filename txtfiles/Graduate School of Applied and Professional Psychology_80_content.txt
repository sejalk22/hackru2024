          Services Offered
      





Evaluation and Consultation for Adults, Children, and Adolescents


Our assessments typically consist of a comprehensive, semi-structured interview, questionnaire data, history review, and discussion with family members and current treatment professionals. This assessment typically lasts 3 one-hour visits, at the end of which diagnostic information and treatment recommendations are reviewed with the patient, and other treatment providers where applicable.




Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Program


Assessment, consultation, and treatment services are provided to adults and children who have experienced trauma from a variety of sources, such as military service, terrorist attacks, auto accidents, sexual assault, or natural disaster.  The Veteran Readjustment Program provides assessment and treatment for men and women who have served in US military conflicts from World War II to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  Contracts with the NJ state and Federal Veterans Administrations allow the Anxiety Disorders Clinic to provide cost-free assessment and treatment to eligible veterans and their families.




Individual, Couples and Family Therapy for Anxiety and Mood Disorders


Therapy is usually provided on a weekly basis, and is centered on identifying, understanding, and directly targeting symptoms of the various disorders.




Group Treatment for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in Adults


Treatment is offered for participants who are likely to benefit from a group-level intervention.  This may include, but is not limited to, individuals who have had previous experience with exposure therapy and are seeking interventions to assist with maintenance of gains, individuals who have milder or less impairing symptoms, and/or those interested in receiving interventions that may provide the foundation for individual treatment while on the clinic's waiting list.  This treatment may also be offered as an adjunct to individual therapy.  Groups typically consist of 4 to 6 participants and are twelve weeks in length, with a 90-minute session each week.  Every effort is made to match participants in order to maximize group benefit.




Child and Adolescent Program for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)


 
Comprehensive services are offered for families with children suffering from anxiety disorders. These include individual cognitive behavioral therapy, parents support and training, and separate child and adolescent group treatments. Contact the clinic to inquire about current group offerings. Multi-factorial assessment and written evaluations are provided to both families and schools when applicable.












          Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Program
      


Assessment, consultation, and treatment services are provided to adults and children who have experienced trauma from military service, 9-11 terrorist attacks, auto accidents, rape, or natural disaster.
