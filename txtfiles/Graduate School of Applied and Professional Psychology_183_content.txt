          Overview
      


The GSAPP faculty recognizes the impact of evolving health care delivery systems and other social and professional changes on the practice of professional psychology and continuously reviews its training goals and curricula. The combination of full-time faculty and part-time faculty, many of whom are professionals working in the community, enables GSAPP to offer both rigorous theoretical courses bases on current research and practice-oriented courses that build upon this scholarly foundation.
