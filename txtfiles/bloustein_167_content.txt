Application Procedures

Testing
Standardized testing requirements for the academic programs include (except for programs where noted):

Graduate Record Examination

The Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy requires applicants for matriculated status to submit results of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE)*. GRE information and application forms may be obtained by calling (609) 771-7670 or by writing to:
Graduate Record Examinations ProgramsEducational Testing ServiceP.O. Box 955Princeton , NJ 08541-0955U.S.A.
The Educational Testing Service requires at least six weeks to process and report formal and final GRE scores.
*Please note: The GRE has been waived for ALL MASTER’S applications seeking admission for spring / January 2023 and fall / September 2023 intake. The GRE is REQUIRED for applications seeking fall (September) 2023 intake for the PhD program only.
** Please note: The Traditional Master of Health Administration degree program does NOT require a standardized test score (GRE).

Foreign Applicants—TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) / IELTS / DuoLingo

Satisfactory English proficiency is a prerequisite for graduate study at the university. Applicants failing to meet minimum standards for English proficiency may be required to take a test upon arrival at the university and to take coursework in English as a second language. Nonimmigrant students are also expected to present evidence of adequate financial resources.
The university may deny admission to nonimmigrant students lacking satisfactory English proficiency or adequate financial resources. The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is required if English is not the applicant’s native language. We also accept IELTS and DuoLingo scores. Our TOEFL Institution Code for score reporting is 2790. For further information, write to:
TOEFL Educational Testing Service P.O Box 955 Princeton, New Jersey 08541-0955 U.S.A.

Admission
All admission decisions are informed judgments based on the applicant’s previous academic performance, standardized test scores (if applicable), experience and achievement, recommendations, and other relevant data as presented in their application for admission.
The number of students who can be accommodated in some programs is limited.
Applications are reviewed by a set number of program faculty, on a case-by-case basis as an “admissions committee” and decisions are collectively made on those applications with a final determination transmitted by the program director to the Dean.  The admissions committee may establish protocols and standards annually based upon collective determination and applicant cohort shifts.  The Dean’s Office reports those determinations to the university admissions office, responsible for implementing decisions.
Because admission requirements vary among the programs, applicants should carefully review the information and instructions provided in the application form, and consult with the individual program with questions.
You apply to the Bloustein School graduate programs online through the Office of Graduate and Professional Admissions.

Notification of Admission
Applicant review at the Bloustein School does not begin until after the posted deadline. Applications received before the deadlines are held until review begins. Applicants will receive written (email) notification of admissions decisions from the Office of Graduate and Professional Admissions, the Dean of the Bloustein School, and the academic program director. Admission will be confirmed on a certificate of admission (post mail), which may list certain conditions. Such conditions should be satisfied prior to registration unless otherwise indicated. All deadlines must be met.
Students who fail to register for the term to which they were admitted should contact the school at 848-932-2727 for further instructions.

Nonmatriculated (Non-degree) Students
The Bloustein School welcomes students to take classes on a non-degree basis, providing there is space available. Applicants should choose non-degree study on their application from the Office of Graduate and Professional Admissions. Applicants who are accepted as non-degree students are permitted to register for an unlimited number of courses with the approval of the appropriate program director. Such courses carry full credit at the university; however, a maximum of 12 credits will be accepted by the school toward a degree should the student later be admitted to a degree program. Nondegree students who wish to enter a degree program in the Bloustein School must file an application and fee for admission with the Office of Graduate and Professional Admissions online. Admission to non-degree status neither predisposes nor guarantees later admission to a degree program.
