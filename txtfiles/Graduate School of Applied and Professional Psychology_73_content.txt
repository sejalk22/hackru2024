          About the LifeSPAN Autism Lab
      


The Lifespan Symptom Profiles, Achievements & Needs in Autism (LifeSPAN Autism) Lab is led by Dr. Vanessa H. Bal.
Dr. Bal's research aims to advance understanding of autism in adulthood. By emphasizing a lifespan perspective, the lab encompasses four broad research areas:
Defining meaningful achievements and specific needs of autistic adults;
Characterizing how autism manifests across the range of cognitive and language abilities at varying developmental stages across the lifespan;
Identifying behavioral, biological and contextual factors that affect longer-term adult outcomes;
Developing and adapting approaches to support the well-being of autistic adults.
Across these areas, research in the lab strives to develop and refine methods to assess and quantify individual strengths and challenges. This includes projects to evaluate methods that may be useful in screening and diagnosis, tracking of symptoms across development, and evaluating response to treatment. By emphasizing a multidimensional, lifespan perspective, this work aims to delineate relationships between dimensions of social-communication, language, cognition and emotion in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders in order to inform the development of targeted interventions that capitalize on individual strengths in order to promote well-being for individuals with Autism across the lifespan.

          Student Perspective
      


"My experience doing research at the LifeSPAN Lab here at Rutgers has been really enriching. The aims of our research center around relevant aspects of community life and help to advance our understanding of individuals with autism and how to best support them. Being able to participate in research studies has given me insight into the successes and challenges in our field regarding growing clinical populations such as the autistic population. My roles in our lab's research have been extremely meaningful to me and have helped me grow as a future professional by providing me with perspectives that I had not been exposed to from coursework alone.” - Eden Keinan, MAP Graduate, Class of 2023; GSAPP Clinical PsyD Student
