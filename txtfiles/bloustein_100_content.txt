ABOUT  |  MAJORS & MINORS  |  CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS  |  STUDENT PROJECTS  |  APPLICATION CYCLES







Thank you for your interest in the undergraduate programs at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy.
The Bloustein School educates a select pool of students, preparing them for both public and private sector careers, teaching and research professions and service at all levels of government.
The Bloustein School provides students a unique opportunity to pursue their passion for public service and research and offers bachelor degrees in five major fields. The school also offers eight minor programs. With an undergraduate population of approximately 900 students, the Bloustein School is small enough to offer students individual academic support and the focus of a professional school, but large enough for students to enjoy all the benefits, resources, and opportunities of a leading public research university.

View Majors & Minors

Undergraduate students that are declared in a Bloustein School major fall into one of the two following categories:
Joint Degree Students

A Rutgers-New Brunswick student who has declared one of the Bloustein School majors while remaining in their primary unit (SAS or SEBS)
The student is required to complete the core curriculum of their primary unit AND the Bloustein School major requirements.

Direct Admit Students

A student that is admitted directly to the Bloustein School either by transferring from an outside school or completing a school-to-school transfer from another Rutgers school.
The Bloustein School is the student’s primary unit, so the student is required to complete the Bloustein School General Education Requirements, the major program requirements, and adhere to the school’s academic policies and procedures.
The Bloustein School does not require completion of a second major or minor, except Planning and Public Policy.


Advising

Students should seek advising from the Office of Academic and Student Services. The staff provides information about the school’s programs, admissions and degree requirements, scheduling, course registration and more. Each student is assigned an advisor when admitted to the Bloustein School.  The advisors are listed in the right-hand sidebar. Please contact your advisor or write to undergrad@ejb.rutgers.edu to schedule an appointment.
When requesting an advising appointment, please include your first name, last name and RUID# as well as your academic concerns so we can better assist you.

Majors and Minors

The Bloustein School welcomes current Rutgers-New Brunswick students as well as prospective students to consider our major and minor programs of study. We offer five undergraduate majors and 9 minors.
Students should declare a minor with their matriculating school. They need not apply for minor status with the Bloustein School. Only courses with a grade of “C” or better can be counted toward the minor program of study.









Health Administration

The major in Health Administration (501, 501D), which leads to a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree, provides students with the skills, competencies, and relationships to become highly-effective supervisors and managers. Graduates of this program will have secured competencies in general management, a strong and effective set of communication skills, an understanding of the importance of ethical business conduct, as well as participation in an intense professional internship.









Planning & Public Policy

The Planning and Public Policy major (762, 762D) provides students with a foundation in areas such as city dynamics, environmental aspects of cities, community health, urban poverty, public policy, housing issues, social concerns, fiscal matters, and land use planning. Students are prepared for entry-level professional management and planning positions focused on overseeing and improving public programs, such as transportation, housing, planning, the environment, finance, economic development, and urban renewal. These career paths can be found in business, government, education, banking, and nonprofit settings. This program also prepares students for graduate education in public administration, public policy, and urban planning.









Public Health

Our major in Public Health (832, 832D) offers a dynamic learning environment that prepares public health students to tackle society’s most pressing contemporary health-related issues. Our focus is on a highly transferable skill set applicable to many career pathways that directly or indirectly impact population health. Our minor is well-matched to majors in environmental policy, institutions & behavior; exercise science; food science; health administration; biological sciences; kinesiology & health; nursing; nutrition; psychology; social work; as well as clinical health tracks such as pre-medicine/dental.









Public Policy

The public policy major and minor (833, 833D) prepare students for careers in the public, non-profit, or private sectors, or for graduate studies in the fields of public policy, law, politics, public administration, criminal justice, labor and employment relations, sociology, and women and gender studies.









Urban Planning & Design

Urban Planning and Design (971, 971D) combines these two processes to provide students with a sharper focus on city design, community development, GIS and graphic communication, as well as planning practice.









Public Administration & Management
Minor Only

This minor is well-matched to majors in public policy; criminal justice; economics; human resource management; labor studies & employment relations; political science; social work; as well as the pre-law track.









Urban Studies
Minor Only

This minor is well-matched to majors in sociology; economics; labor studies & employment relations; political science; social justice; geography; psychology; ethnic studies; public health; urban planning and design; as well as the pre-law track.









Medical Ethics & Health Policy
Minor Only

The minor in Medical Ethics and Health Policy enables undergraduate students to explore the conceptual foundations of medical ethics as well as develop an appreciation of how they inform contemporary health policy in an era of major scientific innovation, technological advances, and resource constraint.









Disability Studies
Minor Only

The Disability Studies minor examines the meaning, nature, and consequences of disability, as a social, cultural, and political construct. It provides students the opportunity to challenge normative ableist paradigms that reinforce rigid ideas about the body and personhood for people with disabilities.
This minor is well-matched to majors in public health, public policy, urban planning and design, planning and public policy, kinesiology and health, labor and employment relations, visual and performing arts, health administration, sociology, psychology, and more.

Planning and Public Policy majors may not declare the Urban Studies (975), Public Policy (833), and Urban Planning and Design (971) minors. Also, PPP majors may not double major in Public Policy or Urban Planning and Design.

Student Projects

Under the direction of faculty and research staff, students at the Bloustein School analyze real-world issues for real clients and develop real solutions. From planning studios to policy practicums to applied field experiences, students use a range of analytic, design, or research techniques to gain practical experience. They consider socioeconomic, demographic, environmental, political, and other conditions as well as stakeholder engagement as they research and assess projects, and are encouraged to use “best practices” in order to develop solutions that are equitable and efficient.

Application Cycles

Students in the School of Arts and Sciences (SAS), the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences (SEBS), and Rutgers-New Brunswick professional schools who wish to declare a Bloustein School major must complete the Application for Declaration of Undergraduate Major.  The applications are reviewed on a cyclical basis prior to the peak times in each semester (add/drop period, pre-registration, and end of term) and summer session. Dates are subject to change with certain updates to the Academic Calendar.
Once you apply, you will be notified of the admission decision via email on the notification date. During the fall and spring, this will assist newly admitted students in pre-registering for the next term as a major.
Students admitted during summer may have the opportunity to change fall course registrations to majors-only courses after declaration. However, certain courses may be closed and special permission numbers may not be available.
The 3-day application periods will accommodate students who miss the deadline for the main cycles.
Note: If a student misses the 3-day application period, they can apply for the next main cycle. Although the application form is accessible at all times, the decisions will only be provided on the notification date of each cycle.
