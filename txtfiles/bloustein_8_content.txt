The Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning & Public Policy – Serving New Jersey Since 1992





About Us

At Rutgers University’s Bloustein School, the disciplines and professions of urban planning, public policy, public health, health administration, and public informatics are strongly situated in an educational context that stresses social science education and public service.
Located in New Brunswick, NJ, the school’s research and scholarship touch on a wide array of issues that affect public welfare including designing healthy communities, better understanding the social determinants of health, researching ways to effectively and economically combat and adapt to climate change, and much more.
Our students are being trained to think about what can be done to make society better.



The Bloustein School serves as one of the nation’s key centers for the theory and practice of planning and public policy scholarship and analysis.
 
The establishment of the School of Planning and Public Policy was one of former Rutgers president Dr. Edward J. Bloustein’s last acts as president, and it was named in his honor in 1992.
Citing his leadership in establishing partnerships between the university, state, and private sector as well as his great involvement in the public service mission of the university, the Rutgers Board of Governors noted that he often spoke of the need for a school to serve local and state public policy concerns and of the importance of community service as part of a liberal education.

Our Mission

The mission of the Bloustein School is to create just, socially inclusive, environmentally sustainable and healthy local, national and global communities.

The Bloustein School is committed to a rebirth of the public service ethic in the United States.
The Bloustein ethic engages those who do their jobs not just honorably, but with a passion for their work that alters their surroundings. The Bloustein School seeks to foster new research and thinking that achieve both scholarly recognition and public acceptance.
Edward J. Bloustein — Rutgers president, constitutional scholar, active citizen, philosopher, and teacher — lived a life of civic engagement that the school’s ethic seeks to perpetuate. Research, teaching, and outreach at the Bloustein School aim for intellectual originality and practical rigor in an atmosphere of spirited and open debate. Bloustein activities are rooted in diversity of experience and thought. They create settings where individuals and communities can flourish. The Bloustein ethic strives to improve the quality of public discourse by producing ideas and measures that have impact.
The ethic focuses on good civic design in its broadest sense, encompassing such endeavors as housing, transportation, workforce development, public health, economic development, ecological balance, and social justice for the disadvantaged.
With our graduate urban planning program ranked 3rd nationally, an accredited graduate public policy program, the undergraduate public health program ranked 4th nationally, and our master of health administration ranked 32nd nationally, the Bloustein School supports a wide variety of educational activities including continuing education and conferences for professionals and alumni, and a range of research centers focused on major planning and policy issues.
