Students register for 150 hours for practicum which includes 30 hours of Advanced Supervision conducted at GSAPP, Rutgers University. Students are responsible for tracking all of their hours and activities so that both GSAPP and their practicum supervisors can review these hours.
The overarching goal is to familiarize student with the CST and role of school psychologist. Exposure to non-CST roles for school psychologists is possible, but must occur in conjunction to the CST role, in order to meet NJ Dept. of Ed certification requirements.
Students are advised that practicum sites are NOT responsible for providing specific practicum experiences to meet GSAPP course requirements (for example, testing, consultation cases). However, the ability to utilize real-world cases and experiences certainly enhances student’s ability to learn and most students prefer obtaining certain experiences in their practicum, if possible, because it enhances meaningfulness for them.
