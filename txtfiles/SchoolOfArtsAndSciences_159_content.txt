          Presidential Faculty Diversity Initiative
      


A diverse faculty is a cornerstone of academic excellence. By reaching out far and wide to recruit a diverse cohort of faculty who will then be supported, mentored, and developed in a way that fosters retention and eliminates isolation, Rutgers will set in motion a self-reinforcing academic community that is committed to diversity and inclusive excellence. 
A universitywide Presidential Faculty Diversity Initiative strategically aligns with the overarching goals set out in our Diversity Strategic Plan. Each of the programs within the Presidential Faculty Diversity Initiative is designed to help further Rutgers’ goal of diversifying its faculty and graduate community.
