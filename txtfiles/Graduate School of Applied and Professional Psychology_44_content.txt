GSAPP has over 1300 alumni who practice in 17 countries. Our alumni share a common bond and are part of a vast, influential, global community. The GSAPP Alumni Organization (AO), led by Dr. Joseph Conerty (Clinical PsyD, 2013), supports educational, training, and networking opportunities for GSAPP graduates and current students. The AO provides a scholarship to an incoming student, maintains an online job bank (in process), offers mentoring and supervision to students and alumni, assists in fundraising for the school, and more. GSAPP students are encouraged and welcomed to join the AO immediately upon graduation. Read on!

          Alumni Perspective
      


Samreen Rizvi – Alumna, Master of Applied Psychology- Applied Behavior Analysis (MAP-ABA) Track and one of the "50 Faces of the DDDC"
"My experience studying in GSAPP was nothing short of tremendous. I was part of the first batch of the MAP program in 2018 and chose the ABA Track to complete my degree. I found the course curriculum to be very challenging but extremely rewarding. The ABA coursework sequence and practicum opportunities provided the ideal blend of the sort of clinical training that is needed to be an effective BCBA. I had many professors in the MAP program who inspired my best efforts and who helped me greatly. Dr. Fiske, Dr. Kahng, Dr. LaRue, Dr. Bal - just to name a few - provided the challenge essential for learning in each course, but not without the support to succeed. I use the knowledge and skills I learned in the MAP program every day as a BCBA in the Fairfax County Public Schools in North Virginia. I owe all my professional achievements to Rutgers, GSAPP and the MAP program!" 




















          Alum/Faculty Viewpoint
      


Dr. Jennifer Foster (School PsyD, 2010) Assistant Teaching Professor, Director of Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) Programs, School Psychology Department, GSAPP, 
"I am thrilled to be back at GSAPP. During my time here as a student, I remember feeling a strong sense of community and support from faculty and staff. I came to GSAPP as as a practicing professional, an advanced student with unique needs. Through the help of my mentors, I was able to follow my passion of systems-level work and forge a new pathway to improve the delivery of mental health services in schools. 
After I graduated, I continued my partnership with GSAPP through teaching and supervising practicum/internship students. It was important for me to stay connected and find meaningful ways to give back to a community that gave me so much. After nearly twenty years working in public schools, I have come full circle and now have the opportunity to share what I've learned over the years with students and continue to pay it forward through teaching and mentorship."
