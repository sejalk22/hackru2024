          Getting Around Campus
      


“If this campus is so big, how do I get around?” No worries: We have the second-largest bus fleet in the state, and frequent stops—even after-hours—make it easy and safe. Biking is encouraged with the BikeRU Initiative, or if you prefer to drive, there are more than a dozen parking lots campuswide (permit required).
