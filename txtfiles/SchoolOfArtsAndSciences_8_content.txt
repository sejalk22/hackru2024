Money Matters 






A university education is one of life’s biggest investments, so it’s reassuring to know a Rutgers education gives an outstanding return on that investment. Our financial aid office is ready to tell you more.
Rutgers is committed to making higher education accessible to academically deserving students. For example:
More than 75% of Rutgers undergraduate students receive some form of financial aid through a wide range of need- and merit-based programs.
Rutgers is a direct-lending institution, which means that eligible students can obtain federal Stafford Loans and Parent PLUS Loans directly from the U.S. Treasury. These loans are the safest education loans available and are not subject to the volatility of the open market.
