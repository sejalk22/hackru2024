          The Education Journey Goes On
      



Learning can begin at any age, and never has to end. Continuing education is part of Rutgers' mission of improving the lives of New Jersey residents and reinvigorating the state's economy.

Rutgers' continuing education lets you choose between non-credit, certificate, and degree programs to suit your particular needs and availability. Which one is right for you?

Non-credit courses are great for all ages: Kids can keep learning over summer break, or retired adults can finally explore topics they always wanted to know more about.















    Earn a Certificate
  





Advance your professional career with a certificate in any number of new areas of expertise, or perhaps train to keep your medical certifications current.















    Earn a Degree
  





Undergraduate degrees aren’t only for full-time students or recent high school grads. University College–New Brunswick can help anyone who’s juggling work, family, or other responsibilities.
