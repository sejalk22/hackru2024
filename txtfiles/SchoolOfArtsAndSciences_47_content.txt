          Paying for Your Education
      


The most important step in the financial aid process is completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). 
Changes to the FAFSA: The FAFSA process is being updated as a result of the FAFSA Simplification Act. The FAFSA for the 2024–2025 academic year will be available in December, and the Rutgers priority filing deadline is March 15, 2024, for all incoming, continuing, and transfer students. Learn about the FAFSA Simplification Act.
Completing the FAFSA annually is how students apply to receive federal grants, loans, merit-based scholarships from Rutgers–New Brunswick, and work-study offers. FAFSA applications also determine if New Jersey students are eligible for state aid. All students are encouraged to submit a FAFSA every year. 
Rutgers Health students must complete an additional application (other than the FAFSA) to be eligible for financial aid.

          Scarlet Guarantee
      


The Scarlet Guarantee is a signature Rutgers–New Brunswick program designed to make college more accessible and affordable for first- and second-year students, offering a "last dollar" financial aid award that covers the cost of in-state tuition and eligible fees. The Scarlet Guarantee is a supplemental program to the Garden State Guarantee.

          Types of Financial Aid
      


Grants
Grants—including Rutgers, federal, and state grants—are awarded to students based solely on financial need. To be considered for any Rutgers grants, you will need to complete the FAFSA.
Scholarships
Continuing and admitted students who submit a FAFSA are automatically considered for a wide range of scholarships awarded by the Rutgers Office of Financial Aid. Merit-based scholarships are based on the academic strength of individual applicants, the overall competitiveness of our applicant pool, and available funding. Scholarships are a form of gift aid and do not need to be repaid.
Loans
Rutgers students and their families might need to supplement their education finances. Several types of loans are available, so consider all options and find the loan that makes the most sense for you.
Student Employment
Through the Federal Work Study Program (FWSP) and the Job Location and Development Program (JLDP), the Rutgers Student Employment Office helps students find jobs to earn their own money and gain work skills.
New Jersey Alternative Financial Aid Application
Through the New Jersey Tuition Equality Act, New Jersey Dreamers who are enrolled in eligible New Jersey colleges and universities can apply for state financial aid.
New Jersey Educational Opportunity Fund
EOF provides financial assistance and support services (counseling, tutoring, developmental coursework) to students from educationally and economically disadvantaged backgrounds who attend participating institutions of higher education in New Jersey.
