The GSAPP Applied and Professional Psychology Student Alliance (APPSA) is an organization run through the Rutgers Graduate Student Association to help promote climate, culture, and diversity at GSAPP. We serve as liaisons between the student body and administration, seek to promote self-care and wellness among GSAPP students and assist in organizing and funding student-run groups. We also hear feedback about what groups people perceive as missing, and help instate them. We have changed and adapted our involvement over the years and are happy to meet your needs, whatever they may be! We represent all GSAPP programs.




Asian Students' Association (ASA)


Contact: Alina Yu, Chloe Chan, Sonali Singal, and Tamina Daruvala Rutgers.AsianSA@gmail.com; Faculty Advisor: Tanya Saraiya tanya.saraiya@rutgers.edu

Our mission is to amplify AAPI voices at GSAPP, tell our diverse stories, share our unique experiences and cultures, and learn more about mental health in the AAPI community and our roles as future AAPI psychologists. Membership is extended to all graduate students enrolled at the Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology.

Contact: Oluwakemi Dauda, Cindy Forestal, and Sherrikah Hayes officialBGSA@gsapp.rutgers.edu; Faculty Advisor: Shalonda Kelly shalonda.kelly@gsapp.rutgers.edu
Formally BSGPPP, BGSA was founded to help increase the number of Black and other diverse students at GSAPP, to enhance student life, and to provide support and community during the rigorous experience of graduate school. We are actively involved in a number of events throughout the year to achieve these goals. We have dinners and informal gatherings where we share, give support, and socialize, and we are constantly searching out new directions to cultivate our experience in graduate school.

The COD is open to all and creates opportunities for outreach and diversity training, education, and training in multicultural psychology by fostering connections between faculty, students and alumni, especially connecting alumni of color with current GSAPP students. The COD is student-focused, committed to social justice, and creates nonjudgmental opportunities to learn and listen. The COD is an official committee of the dean’s office at GSAPP.

As an organization, HOPPS has set forth many goals. Among its most important is to provide a supportive and nurturing environment for its members. An equally important goal is to actively assist the GSAPP in recruiting qualified Hispanic students to our programs. Other goals include: educating the larger GSAPP community to the needs of the Hispanic community, sponsoring educational and social activities that celebrate Latino culture, and collaborating with other GSAPP student organizations and alumni.




The Jewish Student Alliance (JSA)

The JSA also serves to advocate for Jewish students to ensure a rich and positive experience. Events exploring and celebrating Jewish life and culture will be held throughout the year, and all are welcome and encouraged to participate. 




Psychology Students for Social Action (PSA)


Contact: Paulina Calcaterra pcc67@gsapp.rutgers.edu
PSA provides a space for students to develop and implement projects within and beyond GSAPP related to the intersection of psychology and social justice. Previous projects have included: advocating for multicultural training opportunities to return to GSAPP; advocating for gender-affirming practices and inclusivity of gender diversity within the CPS clinic medical record and training; compiling and sharing resources for accessible psychotherapy services for GSAPP students to utilize, etc. The group meets once a month and is an open, collaborative space.

  Ruth and Mel Schulman Endowed Fellowship 







  GSAPP Student Support and Awards
 







  The Cyril Franks Award 







  The Robert Weitz Award 







  The Virginia Bennett Award 













Scholarships 






GSAPP Returning Student Scholarships 2023-2024











Ruth and Mel Schulman Endowed Fellowship 






We are honored and proud to acknowledge The Ruth and Mel Schulman Endowed Fellowship in recognition of Ruth and Mel Schulman’s lifelong commitment to excellence and service. 
 




    
  Recently, Ruth Schulman and son Dan Schulman had the opportunity to meet the first Schulman Fellow, Yuri Finisterre, a second year school psychology student, and his wife Johenn for dinner in New Brunswick.





Dr. S. Ruth Schulman provided outstanding leadership and service to GSAPP for 25 years as our Associate Dean, retiring in 1999.  She was an integral part of student and faculty life at the graduate school from its very beginnings in the early 1970s.  Twenty-five years of students, now alumni, have come to know and love Dr. Schulman for her caring and friendly support.  When students were frustrated by university procedures, when someone needed a sympathetic ear about the struggle of adapting to graduate school, when financial concerns were creating an obstacle to remaining in school, Ruth was often the person to whom they turned.  Along with her warmth and caring, she usually had a creative suggestion to help a student turn things towards a more constructive direction.
Sandy Harris, a former Dean of GSAPP who worked with Ruth closely for a number of years, said that “Ruth had an in-depth knowledge of Rutgers University and GSAPP that she shared generously to help me solve the administrative problems that came my way. In the beginning, she knew more about my job than I did!”
Stanley Messer, the current dean, occupied the office next to Ruth throughout her 25-year career at GSAPP. He recalled that “Ruth had an extraordinary ability to juggle many things at once and yet focus only on you the minute you entered her office. She managed, simultaneously, to provide excellent leadership to the school, to be devoted to her family while pursuing doctoral studies at the Graduate School of Education, culminating in an Ed.D.   
Mel Schulman was a warm, loving man and a highly creative chemical engineer who developed new products with multiple applications for real life.  For example, his interest in adhesives allowed him to understand how windows might fall out of buildings.  One of his strengths was his ability to think about problems in a non-linear way that led him to a variety of possible solutions to seemingly intractable questions.  He was much enjoyed by the GSAPP faculty and staff and would often stop by with the necessary tools to mount plaques on the wall or fix small but annoying problems in the building.  At the event, GSAPP had to celebrate Ruth’s retirement he was called “….GSAPP’s handy tool man.”
Sons Daniel and Joel Schulman have strong roots at Rutgers.  Daniel is a member of the Rutgers University Board of Trustees and lives with his wife Jennie and their children in New Jersey.  Joel is a 1983 graduate of the School of Engineering and lives in Massachusetts with wife Nancy and son.  On behalf of the Schulman family, they have generously established The Ruth and Mel Schulman Endowed Fellowship in honor of Ruth’s leadership at GSAPP and in memory of their late father, Mel.
The Schulman family’s generous gift will allow us to attract the best and brightest graduate students, helping to prepare individuals for lives in a global society and to improve the psychological health and well-being of the people and communities they will serve. Generous private support fosters our ability to train professionals who can integrate scientific knowledge with innovation in the delivery of psychological services to individuals, families, and organizations.  The development of new programs, new agencies, and system change through prevention, intervention, and psychological services is an ongoing mission of our faculty, students, and alumni.  Today, students combine their hands-on supervised clinical training with state-of-the-art, evidence-based preventions and interventions for at-risk and underserved populations in the schools, foster care, prisons, families, and in entire communities.
Fellowship gifts are especially meaningful because of the direct impact they have upon the lives of the recipients.  The Ruth and Mel Schulman Endowed Fellowship is a merit-based award that will help deserving graduate students to pursue a PsyD degree at GSAPP unburdened by financial distractions.  The award highlights academic distinction, promise as a practitioner, extracurricular involvement, leadership ability, community engagement, future aspirations, and character.
Because of the Schulman family’s generous support, our graduates continue to make outstanding contributions to the field of psychology along with key innovations in service delivery, education, and training – helping thousands of children, adolescents, and adults lead happier, healthier, and more productive lives.

To quote Terry Wilson whose written remarks Dean Messer read at the GSAPP convocation on May 19: “Perhaps the most remarkable outcome was the following. The counseling center administration subsequently prevailed on me to train their staff in the guided self-help based on cognitive behavior therapy that Laurie had implemented.

A paper based on her dissertation has recently been published in an important international journal on eating disorders. For all of these reasons Laurie is richly deserving of the Cyril M.
