          Building Community with Purpose
      


Kevin Carolina co-founded the group Minority Men in Medicine at Rutgers. The purpose of the organization is to provide an academic and social support network to increase the number of underrepresented minority men matriculating into medical school. “We believed that representation was important. Seeing individuals who looked like us who were successful in medicine motivated us not to give up, despite the challenges we faced on our paths to becoming physicians,” Carolina said.

          Meaningful Research
      


Julia Fuchs, a self-described “museum nerd,” completed a senior honors project in which she catalogued the university's small but historically rich collection of antiquities from ancient Egypt, then created a website to display them, and wrote a 30-page paper on the collection. “These artifacts show a connection between the modern and the ancient world and those are the things I find the most fascinating,” she said.
Julia Fuchs, history and anthropology major

Bryan Cabezas, Biological Sciences major
