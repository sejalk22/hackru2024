Are we doing enough within our policies to not just accommodate, but also uplift people with disabilities?
On Wednesday, March 27,  join the Bloustein School for an important conversation as we collectively work towards dismantling barriers and building a society where everyone can thrive. Attendees will gain valuable insights into creating spaces celebrating diversity, equity, and inclusion, and ensuring that we all play a significant role in developing an inclusive and just society.
Our annual DEI Lecture will critically assess the systems that seek to build inclusive communities. From access to health equity, discussants will navigate the landscape of inclusivity, shedding light on areas that demand attention and reform.
The lecture will serve as a call to action for students, organizations, and policymakers to examine their roles in driving authentic change. It seeks to foster a deeper understanding of disability justice and its impact on health equity, policy development, and community building. By giving voice to the lived experiences of people with disabilities and examples of disability justice at work, we aim to catalyze tangible strides toward a more inclusive and equitable future for all.
Guest Speaker: Jashar “Shar” Banks ’23, Advocate and Mental Health Specialist, Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care

“Life has taught me important lessons, and sometimes the best way is the hard way.” Raised by a a single mother,  Jashar “Shar” Banks used his upbringing to grasp a better understanding of the value of earned rewards, learning to accept failures as lessons and as a part of success. A wheelchair-bound paraplegic, Shar has focused on personal growth in all areas of his life including work ethic, social skills, and leisure activities. He continues to strive towards success by acknowledging the lessons disguised in inevitable failures as his goal to remain a lifelong learner. Although no longer able to pursue a career path as a firefighter, he hasn’t halted his aspirations to serve others. Pursuing a career as a developmental psychologist with the goal of help youth from troubled and underprivileged communities, the 2023 Rutgers alumnus is currently employed as a Mental Health Specialist for the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.
