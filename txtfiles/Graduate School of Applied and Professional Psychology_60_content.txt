The Doctor of Psychology program in Clinical Psychology educates psychologists for direct practice in clinical and applied professional settings by providing a solid foundation in clinical practice, grounded in the evolving scientific understanding of mind and behavior. Didactic training in broad and general psychological principles is coupled with practical, graduated instruction in a range of assessment and intervention modes. The program takes a pluralistic approach to theoretical orientation, exposing each student to three broad conceptual and treatment orientations, including cognitive and behavioral, psychodynamic, and systems theories.
Infused into all educational and training experiences are awareness of, sensitivity to, and consideration of appropriate approaches for individual differences, such as those associated with age, ethnicity, culture, race, religion, language, socioeconomic background, gender, sexual orientation, and national origin.
