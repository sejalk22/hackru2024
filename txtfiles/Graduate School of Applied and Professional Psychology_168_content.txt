          Overview
      


Welcome to the Department of School Psychology at Rutgers-GSAPP.
We are a vibrant group of scholars, practitioners, and students who are dedicated to highly intensive training and research in the use of empirically-based assessment, intervention, and consultation practices. We emphasize the importance of understanding the role of context, systems, culture, and all forms of diversity in psychological and educational functioning. We also introduce students to a wide array of contemporary, cutting-edge theoretical models and professional practices.
Our department integrates classroom-based learning with numerous opportunities for practice of professional skills through practicum experiences in public schools and a variety of other settings, such as counseling centers, psychological clinics, and pediatrics settings, that serve the mental health and educational needs of children and youth.
Read on to learn more about our highly regarded School PsyD offering and new Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) paths (Certificate and Master's). 




















          Doctor of Psychology (PsyD)
      


The doctoral program in School Psychology (PsyD) prepares psychologists for professional practice with children/youth in schools and other community settings. We emphasize integration of scientific knowledge with innovation in the delivery of psychological services to individuals, families, groups, and organizations.

          Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS)
      


GSAPP, in collaboration with the Graduate School of Education (GSE) has led in the development of a series of courses dedicated to translating leading-edge science into effective implementation of MTSS in K-12 settings. GSAPP offers certification and/or a master's degree in Applied Psychology focused exclusively on Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MAP-MTSS) in school settings. These courses have been designed for current or future professionals in education (e.g., general or special educators, instructional leaders, administrators, counselors, psychologists, or other support professionals) who are looking to become change agents in their schools or districts.

"At GSAPP, I am learning everything I need to know and given all the tools I need to be an effective school psychologist. This program, like any, is demanding, but the faculty, staff, students, and clients have all made my experience here worthwhile and meaningful. I am so grateful!"
