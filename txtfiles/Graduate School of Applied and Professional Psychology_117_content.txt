          Scientific Basis Of Psychology
      


The 42-credit Master of Applied Psychology (MAP) offers instruction in foundation knowledge of the scientific basis of psychology and education and training in applied areas of psychology. The program embraces the mission of the school by offering instruction that has an emphasis on civic and global citizenship, social justice and cultural diversity. This course of study provides students with knowledge needed to understand individual and collective behaviors; develop quantitative and qualitative statistical analysis and research design needed to analyze the corresponding physical and environmental contributors to human behavior; and a beginning understanding of the analysis and treatment of behavior problems and disorders.




















          Opportunities For Students
      


The MAP degree will prepare students with the requisite theoretical knowledge; critical thinking and problem solving skills needed to successfully participate in employment or scholastic activities. Students will have opportunities to pursue scholarly activities that prepares them to successfully compete for admissions into doctoral level psychology and related academic programs, and pursue Master’s level career pathways through available concentration and certificate programs (see examples of concentration areas listed below). 
The applied emphasis of the program includes opportunities for students to receive training in applied areas of psychology, participate in practicum, and have opportunities to integrate their didactic and applied learning experiences. There are currently three available tracks for students in the MAP program: General, Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), and Addictions Counseling (ACT). There are additional training opportunities in performance psychology and organizational psychology. 




















          Two Career Paths
      


The MAP program prepares students for two career paths:
Entry into doctoral-level graduate programs in psychology and related fields
Employment in entry level jobs for addictions, autism, and in multiple market sectors that value competence in psychological knowledge and statistical and analytical skills (marketing, healthcare, human relations, industry and government organizations etc.)
The degree offers students opportunities to complete coursework that may allow them to pursue master’s level state certification (e.g., Behavior Analyst or Addictions Counselor). The MAP program is not an accredited clinical psychology training program that leads to state-regulated licensure for psychologists following completion of the MAP degree. Students seeking licensure for clinical practice in psychology must apply to appropriate doctoral programs.

          Program Objectives
      


To provide students with a quality education that equips them with the critical thinking and communication skills appropriate for applied psychology professionals, master’s level graduate and students with an interest in pursuing doctoral level studies in psychology or related fields.
To give students foundational knowledge in psychology and exposure to diverse areas of applied psychology (ex. Autism, Addictions).
Depending on career interests, students will have opportunities to pursue coursework that will lead to concentrations in selected applied fields (e.g., Alcohol and Addictions, Applied Behavior Analysis, and other course of studies affiliated with the program). However, additional field work accompanying course work may be required in certificate programs that lead to state and professional licensure (e.g., Certified Drug and Alcohol Counselor or Applied Behavior Analysis).
*Please note that GRE scores are no longer a requirement. 
**Applications deadlines: Fall Semester, May 30th and Spring Semester, November 30th (ABA track and 4+1 program only).
