The School of Management and Labor Relations was originally established by an act of the New Jersey legislature in 1947 as the Institute of Management and Labor Relations (IMLR). Like its counterparts that were created in the other large industrial states at the same time, the Institute was chartered to promote new forms of labor-management cooperation following the industrial unrest at the end of World War II. It officially became a school at the flagship campus of the State University of New Jersey in New Brunswick/Piscataway in 1994. 
SMLR's History
For an early history of the School of Management and Labor Relations, read the article, "Labor Education at Rutgers University, 1931-1981, and the Establishment of IMLR" written by Eugene McElroy, long-time SMLR Library Associate, and published in the Journal of the Rutgers University Libraries.

Celebrating 25 Years
On March 5, 2020, approximately 100 alumni, faculty and staff of the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations (SMLR) came together to celebrate SMLR's 25th anniversary as a school designated within Rutgers. The evening of networking and celebration featured remarks by Dean Adrienne Eaton; John F. Burton, Jr., the school's first Dean and Professor Emeritus; Patricia A. (Patti) Lee, SMLR ‘95; and Daniel R. Schlademan, LC ‘93. SMLR Assistant Teaching Professor William Dwyer, SMLR ‘97, served as master of ceremonies for the evening. Among the many special guests to share in the evening was Barbara A. Lee, former SMLR Dean, Distinguished Professor, and Rutgers Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs.
