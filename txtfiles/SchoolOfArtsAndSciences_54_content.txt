Publicly Engaged/Community Engaged Scholarship


Task Force Report
In 2019, the Executive Vice President of Academic Affairs (EVPAA) and a faculty task force published a document to broadly define publicly engaged scholarship for Rutgers University. Since then it has been used by all Chancellor-led schools, centers, and institutes for the purpose of facilitating the tenure and promotion process for those who do publicly engaged/community engaged scholarship (P/CES). Now, and as part of the Academic Master Plan launch, the Office of the Chancellor has established a P/CES Task Force of faculty across Rutgers–New Brunswick charged with making recommendations to the Chancellor and the Deans’ Cabinet in order to provide further guidance for the implementation of the general policy outlined by the EVPAA.
