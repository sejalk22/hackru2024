          ADHD Clinic
      


Our clinic is an outpatient specialty program at the Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology (GSAPP), focusing on research and treatment of child and adolescent Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Our therapists are graduate students from the clinical, school, and applied psychology programs who are trained and supervised by Dr. Stephanie Lyon, a licensed psychologist and a faculty member of the Department of Applied Psychology, and Dr. Francine Conway, a licensed psychologist and Dean at GSAPP. 
Traditional treatments for ADHD, both behavioral and medication-based, focus primarily on modifying problematic behavior. At the ADHD Clinic, we take a different approach. Our treatment is designed to support the whole child, by addressing the thoughts, feelings, and relationships that underlie problematic behavior, increasing resilience, and improving emotional/behavioral regulation. We believe that when children live and learn in compassionate environments, their experience of themselves and their behaviors are transformed.
We specialize in proving short-term treatment for children age 5-15 who are struggling with ADHD symptoms. We also provide support for parents and welcome opportunities to consult with teachers and schools.

The Tourette Syndrome Clinic is an outpatient specialty clinic, focusing on the treatment of children, adolescents and adults with Tourette (TS) Syndrome and associated conditions such as anxiety, OCD, and ADHD.
The Tourette Syndrome Clinic was developed in partnership between Rutgers GSAPP and the NJ Center for Tourette Syndrome (NJCTS).  It is estimated that 1 in 100 individuals have TS or another tic disorder, and very few resources are available to assist them. Through this partnership with NJCTS, we have created specialized treatment programs to address the needs of idividuals with Tourette Syndrome and their families. While providing a unique, hands-on learning experience for advanced graduate students, we also strive to increase awareness of TS in the professional community.
Our clinic therapists are advanced doctoral students from the GSAPP clinical and school psychology programs who are trained and supervised by Director Dr. Amanda Ferriola, PsyD, who is a licensed psychologist with expertise in TS and common associated conditions.
Our clinic specializes in providing diagnostic assessment and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with a focus on evidence-based interventions.
Our clients are referred from NJCTS, the Rutgers community, and the surrounding communities, schools and human service agencies. They consist of children, adolescents, adults with tics, and the parents and other family members of individuals with TS.
