Undergraduate Student Advising and Resources

Students of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy are served by the one-stop-shop Office of Student and Academic Services, providing support across all program areas including undergraduate, masters and Ph.D.  Staff serve the academic programs, directors and faculty as we support their missions, goals and objectives.  The office sits within the greater Office of the Dean.

Webreg – View and register for courses  – https://sims.rutgers.edu/webreg
Course Schedule Planner – Utilize CSP to plan your course schedule – https://sims.rutgers.edu/csp ​
Online Schedule of Classes – Alternative way to view courses outside of webreg – https://sis.rutgers.edu/soc/#home

If you believe there is an error in the system regarding your requirements, please contact the department that handles those requirements (i.e. a SAS student will contact SAS regarding their Core Curriculum).


Things to keep in mind when adding and dropping classes:

Review your WebReg schedule when you finish dropping courses to be certain your schedule is correct.
Confirm whether your course is online (synchronous or asynchronous), hybrid, or in-person.
It is the personal responsibility of all students to confirm that they are appropriately registered. So, be sure to confirm the accuracy of your schedule.
Check your registration to be certain that withdrawal attempts are successful.


Registration Holds

Registration blocks or holds prevent students from registering for courses.
Students are notified when a registration block or hold is applied and the reason for the hold. Students must resolve the issue causing the hold on their account prior to the hold or block being removed.​
Be sure to check to see if you have any holds on your account prior to your registration window to avoid delays in your ability to register.




Special Permission Numbers (SPNs)

Please review the Bloustein SPN page, which has pertinent information regarding the SPN system, including when you can submit your requests and when you will receive a response to your request – https://bloustein.rutgers.edu/courses/special-permission-numbers/
Check the course’s notes section in webreg to see if it requires an SPN. “Department Staff” will be in the notes section for courses that require an SPN.
Faculty members do not issue or grant SPNs. Requests must go through the SPN system. If the course is not showing in the system, declared students should contact their assigned advisor or undergrad@ejb.rutgers.edu. Prospective students should contact ugadmissions@ejb.rutgers.edu for assistance.
