          Overview
      


GSAPP offers students multiple pathways to academic training in applied behavior analysis (ABA).
For those seeking a master’s degree, consider our Master of Applied Behavior Analysis (MABA) program or Master of Applied Psychology program (MAP-ABA concentration).
For those who already have a relevant graduate degree or are pursuing a graduate degree in another program, consider our graduate Certificate in ABA.
For those interested in seeking training in special education with specialization in ABA, consider the Master’s Degree Program in Special Education with the ABA sequence.
All programs are designed to train students to become exceptional behavior analysts who provide the highest quality of care using state-of-the-art, evidence-based practices. 




















          Master of Applied Behavior Analysis (MABA)
      


The Master of Applied Behavior Analysis (MABA) Program in the Department of Applied Psychology at GSAPP trains students to become highly-skilled behavior analysts who apply evidenced-based behavioral interventions to address the behavioral challenges of individuals in need. Our program is perfectly aligned with Rutgers University’s and GSAPP’s mission to train professionals who can integrate scientific knowledge with innovation in the delivery of clinical care that helps individuals and the local, national, and global communities where they live. Students have the opportunity to learn through coursework as well as real world experiences. Graduates will be well-educated, qualified, and competent direct-service behavior analysts and clinical researchers who have a special commitment to direct community involvement and to underserved populations.
Students who enter our program will receive a 42-credit Master of ABA degree, which includes instruction in foundation knowledge as well as education and training in applied areas of behavior analysis.
The foundation is based on knowledge of the scientific basis of ABA and the values our school embraces--civic and global citizenship; social justice and helping the underserved; and cultural diversity. It is our expectation that these values will become the lens through which students view human interactions and will be emphasized in their supervision groups.
The applied emphasis of the program includes opportunities for students to receive training in socially-significant areas of behavior analysis, participate in practicum, and have opportunities to integrate their didactic and applied learning experiences. This program will prepare graduates to become BCBAs who can independently practice ABA or continue to obtain their doctorate in behavior analysis.

          A Quality Education
      


The Association for Behavior Analysis International has verified our courses toward the coursework requirements for eligibility to take the Board Certified Behavior Analyst® examination. Applicants will need to meet additional requirements before they can be deemed eligible to take the examination. Our courses are based on the Behavior Analyst Certification Board’s Fifth Edition Task List. Our faculty diligently prepare students for the BCBA exam through classroom learning and relevant fieldwork assignments. The recent pass rate of the exam for Rutgers’ first-time test takers are as follows: 2021 - 54% | 2020 - 93% | 2019 - 80% | 2018 - 93% | 2017 - 82% | 2016 - 81%. It is important to note that "Pass Rate" is only one indication of the value of a program and that other variables do impact test scores/pass rate beyond University programming. Proper supervisory experience increases the likelihood of passing the BCBA exam. Many of our students work and gain experience at Rutgers-affiliated programs as well as off-site organizations.
 



















          ABA Academic Programs FAQs
      





What is the difference between the Masters in Applied Behavior Analysis (MABA) Program and the Masters in Applied Psychology (MAP) – ABA Track?


Both programs will train graduate students to become exceptional clinicians who provide the highest quality of care. The MAP program allows for additional coursework in general psychology whereas the MABA program focuses primarily on ABA-related courses. Additionally, although both programs emphasize the importance of evidenced-based treatment, the MABA program also places more of an emphasis on having students participate in clinical research through a thesis option and other opportunities.




I work during the day, can I fit courses into my schedule?


Our courses are scheduled for 2.5 hrs, Monday-Thursday at 3:35 p.m. or 6:15 p.m. to accommodate those students who work during the day. We find that working in ABA-related organizations strengthens the graduate training experience. Work experience helps to synthesize the course content.




Do you offer BCBA supervised fieldwork experience?


Although we encourage our graduate students to participate in ABA-related fieldwork experiences, we do not place students nor can we guarantee that you will complete all the BACB fieldwork hours by the time you graduate. Many of our students work at ABA sites at Rutgers as well as outside of Rutgers.




Is this program in person or online?


Our program is in person. Classes are typically taught on the Busch Campus.




What have graduates of the program gone on to do?


Graduates of our ABA academic programs have gone on to obtain their BCBA so that they can work for private companies, public schools, private schools, and university-based programs. Additionally, our students have continued to doctoral programs.




Does completion of one of the programs guarantee acceptance into a doctoral program?


Although beneficial, this does not guarantee acceptance.




Am I required to write a thesis for the masters programs?


The MABA and MAP programs require a capstone, which is a demonstration of competence. The MABA program also has a thesis option to demonstrate research competency, which may be important when applying to doctoral programs.
