Philanthropy Impact Report

Support Bloustein

The Bloustein School supports a wide variety of educational activities, including undergraduate programs, master’s degree programs, and doctoral degree programs, as well as outreach programs and conferences for professionals and alumni.
The Bloustein School serves as Rutgers University’s premier center for the theory and practice of planning and public policy. The school’s graduate urban planning program is ranked #3 the nation among schools of planning and accredited by the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning (ASCP) and the Planning Accreditation Board (PAB). The public policy program is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (NASPAA), and the school is a leader in areas such as smart growth, transportation policy, workforce development, urban redevelopment, energy and environmental policy, public health, and conflict resolution. The Master of Health Administration was awarded accreditation by the Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education (CAHME) in early 2021. In 2023, the MHA program was ranked #32 among almost 100 graduate health administration programs, and is ranked #1 in New Jersey.
The undergraduate public health major became one of the first standalone baccalaureate programs accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH) in 2016. College Factual has ranked the Bloustein School among the Top 10 best colleges for a major in public health since 2016. In 2018 and 2019, the program was ranked the #1 program for veterans interested in studying public health.
Support from alumni, friends, and partners enhances the school’s ability to educate the next generation of professional leaders, and to achieve national distinction in both our research activities and degree programs.

Graduate Fellowship for Social and Environmental Justice

Awareness of the long-standing challenges affecting disadvantaged populations, particularly people of color, has grown over the past decade. These challenges were noticeably exacerbated in 2020 by the pandemic and its economic downturn. Issues such as income inequality, food insecurity, voting rights, healthcare disparities, disproportionate environmental impacts on disadvantaged communities, immigration rights, and sexual orientation are all prominent in political and policy discussions. This Fellowship will support students whose courses of study have an emphasis on applied topics of social and/or environmental justice. To increase and maintain the educational benefits of diversity, so long as it is permitted by law, the donor desires that consideration be given to students who are members of a minority group that is underrepresented at the Bloustein School.
