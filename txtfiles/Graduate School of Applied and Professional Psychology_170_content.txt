Read more about THRIVE Red Bank, an exciting new project that the RCAAS is driving with Parents with a Plan!
 
THE RUTGERS CENTER FOR ADULT AUTISM SERVICES (RCAAS) offers adults on the autism spectrum one-of-a-kind support programs that make an independent and fulfilling life possible. Simultaneously, it advances research and ensures that each year, our graduates leave Rutgers prepared to enter careers in support of this underserved population. The Center is staffed by a highly experienced senior team and trained Rutgers students. Its programs provide the support needed to enable full integration into Rutgers and the surrounding community. From vocational training to academic support, social support and clinical services, the Center equips those it serves with the tools needed to enhance and maintain autonomy—all while providing innovative training and facilitating translational research to inform best practices going forward.
The RCAAS has four distinct, yet collaborative units, as highlighted below:
