          Higher Ed Access, Enhanced
      



The Scarlet Guarantee is a signature Rutgers–New Brunswick program designed to make college more accessible and affordable, offering a "last dollar" financial aid award that covers the cost of in-state tuition and eligible fees.















Program Details
      


Launched in Fall 2022, the Scarlet Guarantee is a Rutgers University–New Brunswick grant program that provides financial support for first- and second-year undergraduate students. Together with the Garden State Guarantee, a New Jersey State Aid Program, they provide a transformational opportunity for students that bridge the gap of resources needed to start and finish their higher education.
With the Scarlet Guarantee and Garden State Guarantee programs, full-time New Jersey residents who have completed their FAFSA or NJAFAA will now have all four years of their tuition and eligible fees covered depending on Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) for as long as these programs last. These programs are last-dollar financial aid awards that cover the entire net cost, after all other grants and scholarships have been applied.
Students are encouraged to read the eligibility requirements for both the Scarlet Guarantee and Garden State Guarantee programs. 




  Garden State Guarantee FAQs 















How It Works
      


The Scarlet Guarantee program consists of three funding tiers based on your family’s adjusted gross income (AGI) as reported on the FAFSA or NJAFAA:
Tier 1 (AGI $0 - $65,000)
Students who meet the eligibility requirements shall pay $0 for tuition and eligible fees, beginning with your first semester.
Tier 2 (AGI $65,001 - $80,000)
Students who meet the eligibility requirements shall pay no more than $3,000 for tuition and eligible fees, beginning with your first semester.
Tier 3 (AGI $80,001 - $100,000)
Students who meet the eligibility requirements shall pay no more than $5,000 for tuition and eligible fees, beginning with your first semester.















Program Requirements

Qualified first- and second-year undergraduate students must be admitted, enrolled, and matriculated at Rutgers University–New Brunswick. First-year students are defined as having earned 0-29 total accumulated credits, and second-year students are defined as having earned 30-59 total accumulated credits.

Q: For how long am I eligible for the Scarlet Guarantee?
A: If you satisfy all eligibility criteria, you may receive the Scarlet Guarantee up to the overall cap of four semesters. To maximize continued eligibility for funding with the Garden State Guarantee you should successfully complete 60 credits by start of year three.
Q: Where can I find my family’s adjusted gross income (AGI)?
A: Your family’s adjusted gross income (AGI) will be indicated on the tax documentation provided to complete your FAFSA or NJAFAA application. The AGI will also be reflected on your completed FAFSA or NJAFAA.
Q: I am enrolling as a first-year student, but I am not eligible for the Scarlet Guarantee at this time. Will I automatically qualify for year two if there is a change in my financial status that places my family’s AGI within the required range?
A: Yes. If you enroll out of high school but later qualify for year two based on a change in your family’s AGI, you will be eligible for year two and this change will be reflected in your financial aid package.
Q: Are transfer students eligible for the Scarlet Guarantee?
A: Transfer students are eligible for the Scarlet Guarantee, provided they transfer to Rutgers–New Brunswick as full-time students for their first and second years.
Q: Are graduate students eligible?
A: No. The Scarlet Guarantee program provides financial support for years one and two of a student’s first undergraduate degree only.
Q: Are Rutgers University–Newark and Rutgers University–Camden students eligible for the Scarlet Guarantee?
A: Rutgers–Newark and Rutgers–Camden have similar programs to the Scarlet Guarantee. More information can be found at the links provided.




Program Benefits


Q: What costs are covered by the Scarlet Guarantee?
A: The Scarlet Guarantee offers a "last dollar" financial aid award that covers the cost of in-state tuition and eligible fees for your first and second year at Rutgers University–New Brunswick. Eligible fees include:
Student fee
School fee
Technology fee
Costs associated with room & board are not covered under this program.
Q: I am an admitted student to the Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, which is a 6-year program. If I receive the Scarlet Guarantee now and later receive the Garden State Guarantee for years three and four, will I receive anything for years five and six?
A: No. The two programs combined only provide financial support for years one through four.
Q: How is the Scarlet Guarantee different from the Garden State Guarantee?
A: The Garden State Guarantee is designed to benefit third- and fourth-year students, and the Scarlet Guarantee serves as a pipeline for first- and second-year students, as well as enhancing benefits in years three and four (eight semesters total).




Receiving the Scarlet Guarantee Award


Q: Do I need to apply for the Scarlet Guarantee award?

A: Simply accept your offer of admission to a school of Rutgers–New Brunswick by May 1 through your Application Portal.

Academic support resources are available on campus to help students successfully complete course requirements and make academic progress.
Q: How many credits should I take each semester while enrolled at Rutgers through the Scarlet Guarantee program?
