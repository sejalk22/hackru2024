The Civic Square Building

The construction of the Bloustein School’s home—the Civic Square Building—realized Dr. Bloustein’s vision that Rutgers University would one day occupy a physical position in the cultural and economic hub of New Brunswick, New Jersey, the host city of Rutgers’ flagship campus. One of the state’s most significant areas for education, health care, and the arts, New Brunswick is home to Rutgers’ historic Old Queen’s campus; Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Saint Peter’s University Hospital, and the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey. The Bloustein School itself is located in New Brunswick’s thriving cultural area, with The State Theater, Crossroads Theatre, and the George Street Playhouse just steps away. Downtown New Brunswick offers something for every taste through a spicy menu of restaurants and entertainment venues.
The Civic Square Building epitomized public-private partnership during the city’s redevelopment in 1995, and was financed by nearly equal investments from Rutgers University and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, through the Port Authority’s mandate to promote economic and commercial redevelopment in the region.
Classrooms and Conference Rooms
Smart classrooms and seminar/conference rooms at the Bloustein School all feature wireless internet connections and ceiling mounted projectors with PC, audio and video hook-ups.
Computer Labs
The Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy operates a state-of-the-art computer laboratory used for both instruction and research. The school’s computing facilities include a main lab, a smaller “information gateway,” and dedicated studio classroom space.
The computer laboratory is used for graduate class instruction, workshops sponsored by the various centers affiliated with the school, and for professional continuing education. Research projects carried out in the laboratory include student projects, doctoral research analysis, and applied GIS grants and contracts.
