          About Us
      


The Children (and Families) Healing After Trauma (CHAT) clinic is an outpatient specialty clinic at the Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology of Rutgers University. Formerly, the Foster Care Counseling Project (FCCP), this clinic has provided mental health support for children in resource and relative care for over 30 years. Through a SAMHSA grant with the National Center for Traumatic Stress, CHAT will expand and provide clinical services to children impacted by trauma.
We serve youth ages 3 to 21 years old and their families referred from New Jersey Division of Child Protection and Permanency (DCP&P), local schools, mental health partners, and general community referrals from surrounding Rutgers University.














          Our Misson
      


Our mission is to support children and families impacted by trauma to rebuild their identity, establish a sense of safety and foster positive relationships with others. Using a multi-systemic, collaborative treatment approach, we hope to give each individual that has faced complex trauma an opportunity to process their experiences and look toward the future with hope.
Services Provided 
Evidence-based Trauma-Focused individual and family therapy
Group therapy
Training/consultation for caregivers, caseworkers and other service providers
Mentorship for children and adolescents when clinically appropriate
Transportation for qualifying DCP&P involved families.
History 
The CHAT Clinic evolved from the Foster Care Counseling Project beginning in 1989, when it was founded by David Brodzinsky, Ph.D., an internationally recognized expert in the areas of foster care and adoption. At the time of the Project’s founding, foster care and adoption were primarily the purview of the field of social work and few psychologists were involved with the provision of specialized services for individuals impacted by trauma. CHAT has refined its focus and services as a specialty clinic to serve youth ages 3 to 21 that are impacted by trauma and represent a lower socioeconomic demographic group of families in need of low or no-cost services. 














































          Therapies
      


The CHAT Clinic serves children in the age range from 3 to 21 years old and their families both within and outside the umbrella of DCP&P. CHAT’s specialty areas include adjustment to resource care, impact of trauma and loss, behavior management, sexual abuse and stress management for caregivers. 





Trauma Focused- Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT)


Evidenced based treatment to address the mental health needs of children, adolescents, adult survivors and families who are battling the effects of a single, multiple or complex trauma experience, including grief, violence or abuse (Cohen & Deblinger, 2006). This treatment modality often allows both children and caregivers to better process overpowering thoughts and emotions that are related to the trauma experience/s which can provide individuals tools to learn how to manage difficult emotions in an adaptive way and manage stress, anxiety and depression. TF-CBT is a skills-based model which encourages caregivers and children to practice the critical components in session and at home in order to be effective. The core components of TF-CBT include psychoeducation, parenting skills, relaxation, affective regulation, cognitive processing of the trauma, a trauma narrative, in vivo mastery of trauma reminders as well as conjoint child-parent sessions.  




Game-Based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (GB-CBT)


Utilizes structured therapeutic games as a primary therapeutic intervention to treat children and adolescents who have experienced abuse (Springer & Murrell, 2013). GB-CBT adopts a directive and systematic approach to treatment while aiming to increase engagement by making therapy fun, relevant and accessible for children and their families. Through role-plays, activities, and processing, children explore and interact with their environments in a way that encourages curiosity and active learning. GB-CBT uses a strength-based approach in emphasizing skill acquisition and working closely with caregivers to reinforce children’s successes and achievements. 




Attachment, Regulation and Competency (ARC) 


Addresses the core areas of impact of trauma in children and adolescents (Blaustein & Kinniburgh, 2018). ARC aims to strengthen the caregiving system, help youth understand and effectively respond to their feelings and arousal and build resilience through the development of self-control and self-understanding. ARC meets these goals by creatively engaging children and their families, providing psychoeducation, and implementing routines and rhythms. These strategies support children and adolescents in making meaning of their traumatic life experiences that empowers them to recognize their survival strengths and re-orient them to more present, goal-oriented skills and behaviors.

Information about Child Trauma
For information regarding child trauma please visit The National Child Traumatic Stress Network.
Here are some specific links by NCTSN:Child Sexual AbuseChild Physical AbuseBullyingDomestic Violence
Information about Resource Care
Children in resource care are some of New Jersey’s neediest and most vulnerable individuals. Many come from chaotic home environments, where they experienced profound neglect, psychological maltreatment, physical and sexual abuse, and/or exposed to parental drug abuse, incarceration and/or intimate partner violence. These children and adolescents have often switched homes and schools several times, never able to feel settled and secure. Establishing safe, stable and nurturing relationships in childhood can have a positive impact on an individual’s psychological and physical health trajectories- the CHAT clinic can help.

Program Supervisor – Nancy Harrison, Psy.D.
Clinic Coordinator – Gjon Tinaj, Doctoral Student
Clinicians
The clinicians at CHAT are doctoral students at GSAPP training to be psychologists. These individuals are dedicated to serving at-risk populations. While providing treatment, student clinicians offer training and consultation to caregivers, DCP&P caseworkers, community organizations, school personnel, and other professions. They also complete thorough intakes and post-treatment assessments at the beginning and end of treatment, respectively, and make recommendations based on findings to optimize each child’s functioning. 
Mentors
Mentorship to all children and adolescents is provided by Rutgers undergraduate students. These students are enrolled in a full-year field experience course taught by Dr. Nancy Harrison. The goals of the course are to provide the students with a deep understanding of the effects of trauma on children and methods of recovery as well as an opportunity to participate in the healing process through reinforcement of evidence-based coping skills.

Who is right for CHAT?

These clinicians receive both group and individual supervision on a weekly basis.

What is the length of treatment?

Does the CHAT clinic take insurance?
