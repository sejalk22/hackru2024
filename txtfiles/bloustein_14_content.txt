Dean Shapiro: A hidden way politics shapes regulation
To address these questions, two forces should be brought to bear. The first is expertise, which is housed at the agencies of the executive branch. The second is political responsiveness, which comes from the president.

NJSPL – Marc Pfeiffer On Fixing the Open Public Records Act
OPRA, the state’s Open Public Records Act is showing its age. Now 22 years old, this important public policy suffers, in part, from age, neglect, unintended consequences, and unexpected use cases.

Student Spotlight: Zoe McGowan
“I want to be a part of creating special places that people feel a connection to and look back on fondly. I would love for people—especially in urban areas where it is often lacking—to have the same opportunity that I had to connect to nature. Choosing urban planning allows me to focus on planning greenspaces within the public realm while sharing what is really important to me.”
