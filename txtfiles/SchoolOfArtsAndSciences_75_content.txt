          Where Bigger is Better
      


Rutgers sits on the shores of the Raritan River, its five campuses—Busch, College Avenue, Cook, Douglass, and Livingston—each pulsing with a distinct vibe. At a total “population” of some 50,000 students, Rutgers University–New Brunswick holds the diversity, the charm, and the surprise of a small city, just waiting to be explored.

  More About Student Activities 





















          The Big Ten Experience
      


You're on your feet cheering with your fellow students, alongside faculty, alumni, and devoted locals. It’s school spirit you can really feel, and something you’ll take with you long after graduation. That’s one more perk of being a Big Ten university.




















          America Converges Here
      


As one of the nation’s most diverse universities, Rutgers–New Brunswick draws strength from the rich variety of perspectives and life experiences represented in our community. Our core values illustrate how we advance, promote, and nurture an inclusive environment.
