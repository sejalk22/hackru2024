Advisory Board

The mission of the Bloustein School Advisory Board is to assist the school in locating and resourcing opportunities to promote and strengthen its academic and research programs, and its partnerships with communities and organizations in New Jersey and beyond.
The Advisory Board is comprised of friends and alumni whose experiences and insights from careers in the private, public and nonprofit sectors collectively benefit the development of the school. Individual members are active and retired CEOs and principals from private industry and nonprofits representing diverse sectors including affordable housing and health care delivery, home building and development finance, community and environmental planning, local and state public policy, and health administration. Some members teach as adjuncts at the Bloustein School; one co-founded the Bloustein Alumni Association.
Collectively, Board members have given and/or pledged in excess of $1.7 million to the Bloustein School and/or Rutgers University.
