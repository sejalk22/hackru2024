Undergraduate Major & Minor


Health Administration







ABOUT  |  SAS & SEBS STUDENTS  |  TRANSFER STUDENTS  |  MAJOR  |  MINOR  |  CAREERS







B.S. in Health Administration

Managing the country’s health care system offers not only new employment prospects, but also provides challenges given the transformative changes occurring in the industry. Health administration and health services management are two of the fastest growing fields with employment growth projected at 32% through 2030 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Handbook. Career choices are both exciting and broadly ranging, including hospital administration, long-term care management, consulting firms, managed care organizations (HMOs), hospices, home health organizations, pharmaceuticals, insurance, medical group practices, marketing, and more.
The major in Health Administration (501, 501D), which leads to a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree, provides students with the skills, competencies, and relationships to become highly-effective supervisors and managers. Graduates of this program will have secured competencies in general management, a strong and effective set of communication skills, an understanding of the importance of ethical business conduct, as well as participation in an intense professional internship.

SAS and SEBS Students (501)

Students in the School of Arts and Sciences (SAS) and students in the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences (SEBS) who wish to remain in their primary unit must apply for admission prior to declaring the major.
SAS students may pursue Health Administration as their first major and remain within SAS. SEBS students may pursue Health Administration as a second major in order to remain within SEBS. SAS and SEBS students can apply for the Health Administration major during one of our application cycles listed here. Applicants must have achieved a minimum grade of “C” or better in the pre-requisite course and be in good academic standing.
Students at SAS and SEBS are advised to declare the Health Administration major no later than their first semester of junior year to ensure completion of the major by their anticipated graduation date.
Only courses with “C” or better may be counted towards the health administration major, and students must complete the Core Curriculum requirements of their primary school.
Health Administration is a credit-intensive major so the minor requirement is waived by SAS. However, students are encouraged to complete a minor, even though they are not required to do so.
Prerequisites (6-7 cr)

355:101 Expository Writing (3)
775:205 Basic Statistical Methods (4) or 200-level of higher equivalent (3-4) (see approved equivalent statistics courses in Degree Navigator)

Careers

The Bachelor of Science in Health Administration prepares students with the skill set needed to enter an administrative career path in the healthcare sector. Students will receive fundamental training in a wide range of administrative areas including healthcare management, finance, marketing, operations, information systems and human resources designed to prepare them for working in administrative settings. Students will grasp economic justifications for management decisions, understand the complexities of the health care system and its impact on patient care and study the policy and ethical contexts in which administrative decisions are made. They will learn to apply management theory and best practices to real life problems in long-term (nursing home and assisted living) and acute healthcare venues, as well as in third-party payer and employment situations.
